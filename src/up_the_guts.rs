SYNOPSIS       

A small town rugby club somewhere in Southland is struggling to put a team on the field for the new season. Failure to do so will likely mean the end of the 126 year old club, and would nicely suit the ambitions of a company wanting to build a rest home on the club's grounds. The team's gruff old school coach does everything he can to find enough players to stave off the demise of the club, while their lack of fitness is addressed by an unlikely quarter with some unconventional ideas. As the team progresses through their competition the personal lives of the players come into focus, including an unrequited love and a well kept secret.       

SET       

The main part of the set is an interior of a small town rugby club changing room. To one side of that is a separate area used as the kitchen of a rugby clubrooms. There is a TV in the kitchen. A whiteboard is set up in the changing rooms.       

There should be the smell of liniment coming from the changing rooms in the theatre.       

TIME       

Present day. The action takes place over about ten weeks.       

## SCENE 1       

*Stan enters the changing room with a clip board. After ten seconds or so he is followed by Bruce and one male extra. Everyone is wearing normal work clothes not rugby gear.*       

**BRUCE**       

(*Sniffs*) I love the smell of liniment in the morning.       

**EXTRA 1** What?       
**BRUCE** Nothing. (*Sees Stan*) Stan.       

*Stan acknowledges him but doesn't say anything. Two more extras enter.*       

**BRUCE** (*To one of the extras*) Hey Steve.       
**EXTRA 2** Bruce.       

*Bruce just nods at the third extra.*       

**EXTRA 3** Gidday.       

# Page 3       

**EXTRA 3** Grab a seat.       

*Everyone sits.*       

**BRUCE** (*Looking round at the others present*) Is this it?       
**STAN** A few couldn't make it. Luke and Sludge'll be here later. Some have pre-registered. We might be a bit short this year.       
**BRUCE** I guess coming last might have put a few off.       
**STAN** Fourth Bruce. We came fourth.       
**BRUCE** (*Nods*) Where's Simon?       

*Stan doesn't say anything so Bruce repeats himself.*       

**BRUCE** Where's Simon?       

*Stan looks down, clearly upset.*       

**BRUCE** I haven't seen him 'round for ages.       
**STAN** No.       
**BRUCE** Is he on holiday?       

*Stan shakes his head, looking disappointed.*       

**STAN** Not good.       
**BRUCE** Injured?       
**STAN** No.       
**BRUCE** Sick?       

*Stan says nothing but looks upset and has to sit down.*       

**BRUCE** He's not...he's not dead is he?       
**STAN** Worse.       
**BRUCE** (*Dawning on him*) Oh no!       
**STAN** Yep. He's playing for Woodbridge this season.       
**BRUCE** Really?!       
**STAN** They offered him more than we could. Two hundred litres of drench and a hundred fenceposts.       
**BRUCE** Bloody hell.       

# Page 4       

**STAN** (*Looking off into the distance. Very upset*) I dunno... he was like a son to me.        
**BRUCE** He is your son Stan.        
**STAN** (*Pause*) Not anymore.        
**BRUCE** He'll be a big loss.        
**STAN** I know. He was in his prime.        
**BRUCE** How old is he now?        
**STAN** Forty-six.        
**BRUCE** Where's Charlie McNally?        
**STAN** He's gone overseas to play.        
**BRUCE** Japan?        
**STAN** Wellington.        
**BRUCE** What about Bob?        
**STAN** He has died.        
**BRUCE** Oh no!        
**STAN** Well he was seventy-two. Marion wore him down.        
**BRUCE** That's sad isn't it.        
**STAN** Just as well really - I was feeling a bit uncomfortable about asking him to play another season.        
**BRUCE** Is Alex playing this year?        
**STAN** No. He's moved to the big smoke.        
**BRUCE** Auckland?        
**STAN** Cromwell.        
**BRUCE** Is the Reverend playing?        
**STAN** No he's suspended for the season remember.        
**BRUCE** Oh yeah.        

# Page 5       

**EXTRA 1** What'd he do?        
**STAN** He told one of the refs he should be crucified.        
**BRUCE** And that wasn't the end of it was it.        
**STAN** No. Enough said.        
**BRUCE** What about Trevor?        
**STAN** Not available. He's had colon cancer.        
**BRUCE** Oh no. That's a bad one.        
**STAN** Yeah. Had to have half of his colon removed.        
**ROGER** (*Entering*) Now it's a semi-colon.        
**STAN**/**BRUCE** Roger!        
**STAN** Good to see you fella.        

*Roger shakes hands with Stan then Bruce.*        

**ROGER** I'm ready to kick some Woodbridge arse!        
**STAN** That's the sprit. You're looking in good shape.        
**ROGER** Have to be. Gotta impress the missus.        
**STAN** Don't waste all your energy on birds will you.        
**ROGER** I've got plenty.        
**STAN** Birds or energy? (*He and Roger both have a wee laugh to themselves*)        
**ROGER** Energy. I'm going to the gym twice a week.        
**STAN** Good stuff.        
**BRUCE** I've been doing some body-building myself.        
**ROGER** (*Sceptical*) Have you Bruce?        
**BRUCE** Yeah, this is what I've built so far. (*Pats his pot tum*)        

*Roger laughs. Stan moves to a table and is writing things down.*        

**BRUCE** (*To Roger*) Been watching the Super Rugby?        
**ROGER** Yeah good isn't it. Haven't missed a game.        
**BRUCE** Who d'ya think'll win?        

# Page 6       

**ROGER** Still early days. Probably the Crusaders.        
**BRUCE** Highlanders might give them a hurry up this year.        
**ROGER** Hope so.        
**BRUCE** They've got some good new players.        
**ROGER** Yeah        
**BRUCE** Have you been to any games?        
**ROGER** No, too bloody expensive to get there. Things are a bit tight.        
**BRUCE** (*Looking over at Extra 3. To Roger*) What's that guy's name?        
**ROGER** I don't know.        
**BRUCE** I've played with him for two seasons. It's too late now.        
**ROGER** I know what you mean.        
**STAN** Right fellas let's take a look at our numbers. So we've got Roger, Bruce, Karl, Steve, good to see you guys.        
**BRUCE** (*Mouthing to Roger*) Karl.        
**STAN** (*Looking at his clip board*) Sludge, Luke, Fergus, Archie, Rowan, Turk, Scotland, Te Mauri, and the twins. (*Long pause*) That's fourteen. Bugger.        
**BRUCE** What about substitutes?        
**STAN** What about them?        
**BRUCE** We won't have enough for them. (*Stan stares back blankly*) Injury cover? Fresh legs?        
**EXTRA 1** Ya can't be playing without substitutes.        
**STAN** Who needs substitutes. In my day you stayed on the whole game; lungs burning like you'd swallowed a bottle of Jif.        
**BRUCE** Yeah but...        
**STAN** (*Interrupting*) You wouldn't leave your mates unless you were rucked so hard you were tripping over your own entrails... and even then you came back on in the second half!        
**BRUCE** We've moved on since then Stan. It's a heath and safety thing.        
**ROGER** You're supposed to have substitutes Stan. I think it's one of the rules.        

# Page 7       

**STAN** Namby - pamby bullshit. Rules? Next they'll be saying you can't tackle round the head. No we don't need'em. (*Looking at a form*) I've got the thing here. It just says we have to have fifteen or we can't register. Woodbridge'd love that.        
**ROGER** Well who else is there? We need one more.        
**STAN** I've had a poster up in the pub for three months. Can't get anyone.        
**ROGER** What about Travis?        
**STAN** His wife won't let him.        
**BRUCE** Tyson?        
**STAN** His probation officer won't let him.        
**ROGER** Ricky?        
**STAN** His Mum won't let him.        
**ROGER** It's bloody social.        
**STAN** (*Indignant*) It is not!        
**ROGER** (*Very sorry*) No I didn't mean that. Sorry Stan.        
**STAN** (*Angry*) So you should be. Honestly Roger. This is the Eastern Southland and Districts Former Premiere Reserve Men's Championship we're talking about. (*Pause*) Third grade, second division. We'll be playing for the Grinder Cup. And I don't need to be reminded how long it's been since we had our hands on the Grinder Cup!        
**BRUCE** Twenty-six years.        
**STAN** (*Not impressed*) Thanks Bruce. (*Pause*) I want that magnificent trophy displayed in our clubrooms again.        
**ROGER** Too right.        
**STAN** Look if we can't get fifteen we can't enter a team. It's as simple as that.        

*Silence for a few seconds.*        

**BRUCE** We could always say we had fifteen.        
**STAN** There's a little thing called integrity Bruce. (*Pause*) Anyway I tried that one other time. Didn't work. (*Reluctant*) I guess I could lace up the old boots ag...        

# Page 8       

*Interrupted by everyone.*       

**EVERYONE** No!       
**BRUCE** St John's don't have the resources Stan.       

*Stan nods resignedly. Roger has been texting and looks down at his phone.*       

**ROGER** Vinnie can play!       
**STAN** Great! (*Brief pause*) Hold on, isn't he in jail for aggravated robbery?       
**ROGER** Yeah. He also got tied up with a bit of a nasty assault. Broke some joker's arm. Allegedly. And he stole a Holden ute and burned down a garage, and he got caught driving while disqualified. But his lawyer said he's gunna get bail.       
**STAN** Thank God for our justice system.       
**ROGER** He might have to wear one of those bracelets on his ankle.       
**STAN** Good - I'll be able to tell how far he's run. So that's fifteen then. Magic. Now, you'll have to pay for your own jerseys this season.       

*General moaning*       

**EXTRAS 1 & 2** What!       
**BRUCE** Bloody hell.       
**STAN** Well we're down to one sponsor. Crusty said we have to win this year or he's gunna pull the pin.       
**BRUCE** No pressure.       
**EXTRA 1** We haven't got a hope of winning.       
**STAN** (*Ignoring Extra 1 as he's annoyed by his negativity*) And that'll be the end of the club. We've been scrapping a team together for the last few seasons. (*Pause*) You'll need to see Raewyn about ordering your jersey's. Don't forget will you - we've only got limited spares. And no coloured boots either. We're not pansies.       
**ROGER** (*To Bruce*) Do you think we'll make the semis?       
**BRUCE** We should do, there's only four teams.       

*Roger nods blankly.*       

**EXTRA 1** We won't go any further though.       

# Page 9       

**STAN** So there's four teams this year. Woodbridge, Blues, Pirates and us, Valley. Two round robins then the semi. No quarter finals. Top finisher plays the bottom and second plays third in the semis. Then the final. Practice'll be Wedensdees 5.30 to 6.30. First game 7 April.        
**ROGER** Can you send us a reminder on Facebook about practice - if it's still on or not.        
**STAN** (*As if saying 'are you crazy'*) No. Look out the winda - if it's raining, hailing or snowing - it's still on. (*Everyone nods unenthusiastically*) We all need to be committed this year. We can default one game but two and we're out. Now l'll go over this again when we're all here but in terms of tactics this is what we need to be doing this season:- we're going to go up the guts, pile in over the top but keeping our feet, clear the pill, spin it wide. Got it? Simple.        
**EXTRA 1** You mean up the middle?        
**STAN** Yeah, up the middle of the field - up the guts. And spin it wide. You can't go wrong. And at the breakdown you need to come through the gate. So from the hindmost foot, from directly behind the ruck not the side or you'll be penalised. Got it?        
**EVERYONE** Yep/Yeah.        
**STAN** There's also going to be a big focus on fitness this year.        
**BRUCE** By who?        
**STAN** By me.        
**ROGER** On your fitness?        
**STAN** No - on your fitness!        
**ROGER** Oh.        
**STAN** And we'll be learning how to deal with the media.        
**EXTRAS** What?!        
**BRUCE** (*Surprised, nearly laughing*) The media?        
**STAN** (*Annoyed they aren't taking it seriously*) Yes the media.        
**ROGER** You mean like '60 Minutes'?        
**BRUCE** 'Country Calendar'?        

*The extras laugh.*        

# Page 10       

**EXTRA 1** Waste of time.       
**STAN** (*Ignoring Extra 1 as not impressed by his negativity*) I was thinking more the local rag. They might approach you for comment. You have to know how to deal with them. I'll school you up on that. And the other thing this season - I don't want to hear any bad language - at practice or in games.       

**ALL** (*General moaning. ie 'Oh what?' and the like*)       

**BRUCE** We're not kids Stan.       
**STAN** 'Shit' and 'Bugger' is fine - that's just normal language but I don't want to hear the f- word. We're better than that. All right?       
**ALL** (*Reluctantly*) Okay/Yep/Alright       
**STAN** Right, l'll see you at practice on Wednesdee, then we're into it a fortnight later.       

*Lights down for the end of the scene, and to indicate passage of time.*       

## SCENE 2       

*The kitchen. A few weeks later. Raewyn is working, humming or singing to herself.*       
*She accidentally knocks a bit of bread onto the floor. She looks left and right and seeing no one, quickly picks it up and uses it to make a cheese roll. Lisa enters looking a bit lost.*       

**RAEWYN** Can I help you dear?       
**LISA** Roger told me to come in. He said I might be able to help.       
**RAEWYN** Did he?       
**LISA** He said you've been busy the last few weeks.       
**RAEWYN** Yes I have been, are you Roger's partner? He's such a sweetie - you know he always brings me in flowers from his Nana's garden.       
**LISA** Does he?       
**RAEWYN** He's a good player too. He's the best in the team by a long way.       
**LISA** I don't know anything about rugby.       
**RAEWYN** Well have to educate you dear. It's been a good season for them so far.       

# Page 11       

**LISA** (*Confused*) Haven't they lost their first four games?       
**RAEWYN** Yes but it's better than last year. (*Pause*) Well it will be if they win this week.       
**LISA** I'm Lisa by the way.       
**RAEWYN** Nice to meet you dear. Raewyn.       
**LISA** Do you have someone in the. in the...?       
**RAEWYN** Not for a long time dear. My husband Derek played for years, and then Callum our son. I got roped into helping out when Derek played. I've been coming here ever since. I love it.       
**LISA** So what do you do, if you don't mind me asking?       
**RAEWYN** We do the after match when they have a home game, but it's not what it used to be. Pies, chippies, that sort of thing. Sausage rolls - they love my sausage rolls. Soup sometimes. (*She indicates the pot on the oven*) The clubs been struggling for a few years so we also do some catering round the district for some extra money, and fund raising too - mainly cheese rolls you know.       
**LISA** I could...       
**RAEWYN** Oh you'll be a big help. Could you just get those loaves on the....       
**LISA** Sure.       
**RAEWYN** Thanks dear.       

*Lisa starts helping Raewyn.*       

**RAEWYN** We have to be very careful about hygiene. It's very popular these days. We've run out of the normal rubber gloves but Angus up at the Vet's gave us some of these. (*She puts on some of those huge long plastic gloves that Vets use to put their hands up cows bottoms, and holds her arms up. Then hands a pair to Lisa, who raises her eyebrows then puts them on*)       
**LISA** You said the club's been struggling?       
**RAEWYN** Yeah. They can't get the numbers, you know. Young ones moving away. We used to get some farm workers from the islands, but that's dried up since the Covid. Ooh they were something to look at - thighs like tree trunks. I bet they'd go all night. All glistening and slipp... (*Shakes herself out of it*) The council's been snooping around too.       

# Page 12       

**RAEWYN** They want the club to go under so they can kick us out and take the land back. They own it you see.        
**LISA** Why do they want it?        
**RAEWYN** Sell it for housing. More rates. They're buggers like that.        
and starts stirring. Chastity enters. She hurries over to the oven where there is a large pot on the stove,        
**CHASTITY** (*Overly cheerful*) Hiya!        

*Raewyn just watches her intently but says nothing. Chastity puts on a big puffer jacket and woollen hat while she is still stirring.*       

**RAEWYN** (*To Chastity*) What are you doing?        
**CHASTITY** (*Looking at a soup packet*) It says stir well and keep warm.        
Raewyn looks at Lisa and rolls her eyes, and shakes her head.        
**CHASTITY** (*Looking at her phone, then to Raewyn*) Did you see this story? Jacinda Ardern has re-signed.        
**RAEWYN** Resigned.        
**CHASTITY** Oh. (*Pause*) Oh can you watch this Raewyn - I've gotta get my nails done. (*As she is leaving*) Put on a jersey.        
**LISA** Who was that?        
**RAEWYN** Chastity Anscome. There's an oxymoron.        
**LISA** (*Not understanding*) Oxy what?        
**RAEWYN** Last season she slept with quarter of the team.        
**LISA** Quarter of the team?        
**RAEWYN** Doesn't sound right does it. We'll make it half. She slept with half the team.        
**LISA** Really?        
**RAEWYN** Yeah. She's Stan's granddaughter. The coach. He's lovely. Tough but fair. She's about as useful as tits on a chocolate teapot. I haven't seen you at the games?        
**LISA** No I've been working in Wellington. Well, a few weeks training - for Work and Income. I'll be at the game this weekend.        

# Page 13       

**RAEWYN** Great. They haven't had to default yet. And close games... most of them, so they've picked up some bonus points.        
**LISA** Roger said he's scored a few... (*Not sure what they're called*) goals?        
**RAEWYN** Tries. Yeah that's right. He's very quick. Did you miss him when you were away?        
**LISA** (*Not sounding convincing*) Mm.        
**RAEWYN** I miss Derek. He's been away for a while.        
**LISA** Oh is he...        
**RAEWYN** He's dead just now.        
**LISA** Oh I'm sorry.        
**RAEWYN** Thanks dear. You know it's true what they say about not knowing what you've got till it's gone. That's one of the reasons I love coming here. We had a lot of fun times here over the years. It reminds me of him.        
**LISA** That's nice.        
**RAEWYN** But you've also got to move on, don't you. That's why if one of those island boys came and swept me off my feet I might just go along for the ride! (*Funny giggle to herself*)        

*Lights down to indicate end of scene and passage of time.*       

## SCENE 3       

*The changing rooms. After practice. An extra enters panting, followed by Stan.*       

**EXTRA 1** I can hardly walk.       
**STAN** Good. I don't want you to walk, I want you to run.       
**EXTRA 1** This is crazy.       

*Bruce enters panting.*       

**BRUCE** Bloody hell Stan, we're halfway through the season - do you want us to be able to play on Saturday or not?       
**STAN** If you want the rewards at the pointy end ya gotta put in the hard yards.       
**BRUCE** I don't know if I want the rewards.       

# Page 14       

**STAN** Do it for the Club then. For the green and gold. (*Chants*) Green and gold all the way!! Green and gold we'll have our day!!        
**BRUCE** (*Sarcastic*) Such a catchy chant.        
**EXTRA 1** I doubt we're going to get to the pointy end.        
**STAN** I'd rather you didn't speak again if you're gonna have that attitude. (*That Extra says no more for the rest of the play*) Now we need to do some media training like I said. Right Bruce you ask me a question as if you're the media and 'Il show you how to deal with it.        
**BRUCE** So I just say.. what?        
**STAN** Just ask a question. Like you're a reporter. (*He pretends to hold a microphone*)        
**BRUCE** Any question?        
**STAN** A rugby question. We need to get this right. (*Long pause as Bruce says nothing*) Come on. What are you waiting for?        
**BRUCE** I need the microphone. (*Stan reluctantly hands over the imaginary microphone*) We're down here at the Valley clubrooms with some breaking news, turns out Stan is actually a woman.        
**STAN** Cut it out. Just ask a question.        
**BRUCE** Why have you got Bruce playing at second five when he's clearly the best fullback in the team? (*He holds the imaginary microphone out to Stan*)        
**STAN** (*Stan grabs Bruce's hand holding the imaginary microphone and pulls it in to him*) No comment. (*Raises his eyebrows as if to say 'Next question'*)        
**BRUCE** Should club players be getting paid for giving up their weekends? (*Bruce nods to himself. Again Stan pulls the imaginary microphone close*)        
**STAN** No comment.        
**BRUCE** Is it true that Roger's jockstrap can only be seen with a very powerful microscope?        
**STAN** (*Stan pulls in the microphone*) Yes. (*To all*) So you get the idea? We want to be open with the media but not too open. I think that's a good balance.        
**ROGER** Yeah sounds good. Thanks Stan.        

# Page 15       

*Stan leaves via side door. Chasity enters from main door.*       

**CHASTITY** (*To Bruce*) Is Pops around?       
**BRUCE** He was just here. I think he'll be back.       
**CHASTITY** I'll wait.       

*She watches as some of the guys change. They deliberately flex their muscles at her. One has his foot resting on the bench and then it slips off causing him to make a fool of himself.*       

**BRUCE** Haven't seen you for a while Chastity.       
**CHASTITY** No. I've been getting over the trauma of not being able to get the new Dior lip-gloss.       

*Bruce sniggers, thinking she is joking, and then realises she isn't.*       

**CHASTITY** I just shut down for a while.       

*Bruce nods.*       

**BRUCE** What are you doing for a job?       
**CHASTITY** Oh you know how there are always competitions - and you can win trips overseas, or cars, all sorts of things - and some you don't even need to buy anything for.       
**BRUCE** Yeah.       
**CHASTITY** l enter all of those.       
**BRUCE** Have you ever won anything?       
**CHASTITY** (*Immediately*) Not a thing.       
**BRUCE** Are you thinking of doing that long term?       
**CHASTITY** No definitely not. No I really want to be an influencer umm... or a doctor.       

*Bruce nods encouragingly.*       

**CHASTITY** I'm doing a part time English course at the moment. We're doing the romantic poets of England.       
**BRUCE** Oh yeah.       
**CHASTITY** Did you know they were tortured?       
**BRUCE** No.       

# Page 16       

**CHASTITY** Yeah They must have had people who really didn't like their poems        
**BRUCE** So you want to be a doctor?        
**CHASTITY** Yeah. You have to do English for I think that's because a lot of people still talk English.        
**BRUCE** I was just watching a thing about a doctor on TV the other day....umm...umm...no I can't remember what it was called.        
**CHASTITY** Ive been watching The Crown on Netflix I didn't watch it when it first came out. Cos I already knew what happened.        
**BRUCE** It's good isn't it?        
**CHASTITY** Yeah. I'm just up to the bit where Winston Peters dies.        
**BRUCE** Winston Peters?        
**CHASTITY** Yeah. He was the Prime Minister of England during the war.        
**BRUCE** Was he?        
**CHASTITY** Yeah. (*Almost laughing*) Its pretty well-known Bruce.        
**BRUCE** Which war?        
**CHASTITY** Vietnam I think.        

*Stan enters, looking like he's on a mission.*        

**STAN** Chastity!        
**CHASTITY** Yes Pops.        
**STAN** (*Pointing at her*) I want you to be our mental skills coach.        
**CHASTITY** (*Enthusiastic*) Okay.        
**STAN** I think it's what we've been missing. Does everyone know Chastity?        
**EVERYONE** (*Except Extra 1*) (*Loudly*) Yes/Yeah!        
**STAN** Good.        
**CHASTITY** (*Doing a silly little wave*) Hiya!        

*Bruce shakes his head and swivels to talk to Roger instead, as he's had enough of Chastity, who gets up and goes over to talk to Stan.*        

**BRUCE** How are things going with Lisa?        

# Page 17       

**ROGER** (*Supremely confident*) Yeah really good.        
**BRUCE** You've been together a while now.        
**ROGER** I know. Six months.        
**BRUCE** Great.        
**ROGER** The good thing is we're on the same wavelength you know. We can communicate without even speaking.        
**BRUCE** Is that right?        
**ROGER** Yeah she just texts me.        
**BRUCE** (*Nods*) Do you ever argue?        
**ROGER** She does.        
**BRUCE** Well you need a bit of that - keeps things interesting.        
**ROGER** You know, I think Lisa might just be 'The One'.        
**BRUCE** The One?        
**ROGER** Yeah the only one who doesn't know I've already got a couple of kids.        
**BRUCE** She doesn't know?        
**ROGER** Nup.        
**BRUCE** You've managed to keep it from her all this time?        
**ROGER** Yep.        
**BRUCE** Are you going to tell her?        
**ROGER** (*Pause of at least seven seconds*) No. (*Pause*) I mean they hang around me when I have access at the weekends. I just say I don't know who they are.        
**BRUCE** I think you probably need to tell her.        
**ROGER** Nah.        
**STAN** Rights fellas. That was a good practice. Just what we needed before Blues on Saturdee. We've got no injuries so we're still hanging in there which is great. I'm still trying to jack up some more sponsorship but l'm not getting anywhere. So if we want to keep the club going we have to be focused on winning. And that will come, with determination, perseverance, and a decent Ref. Now we're showing some good        

# Page 18       

**STAN** individual skills out there, but we have to remember we're a team, and working together is what'll get us over the line. Having said that... (*Roger has picked up a robotics magazine and is flicking through it*) Pay attention Roger. (*Roger puts the magazine down*) We also have to play to our strengths - so that means getting the pill to Roger as soon as possible. Okay?        
**ALL** Yeah/Yep.        
**STAN** Good. Now hit those showers. (*Brief pause*) Bruce, make sure Vinnie doesn't actually hit the showers will you. We can't afford to replace them again. (*Bruce nods*)        

*Lights down for end of scene and to indicate the passage of time.*        

## SCENE 4        

*The kitchen the following week. Raewyn and Lisa are working together.*        

**RAEWYN** (*To Lisa*) You wouldn't have got to see Roger play on the weekend either?        
**LISA** No.        
**RAEWYN** That's their first default. Stan's a bit worried. One more and they're out        
**LISA** Yeah Roger was saying. Why did they default?        
**RAEWYN** Chastity told me Te Mauri got pneumon... in his foot.        
**LISA** Pneumonia in his foot?        
**RAEWYN** (*Shaking her head demonstrating how thick Chastity is*) That's what Chastity said, and she called it P'new- monia.        
**LISA** It's a shame they had to default. Roger really likes Stan. He doesn't want to let him down.        
**RAEWYN** I can understand that. Stan's a lovely bloke. He talks to me quite a bit you know. We're near the same vintage I guess. Bit of a sad story - he had a farm up near Trevathan Station for years. His son Simon was going to take it over but Stan diversified into deer, then the arse fell out of the velvet market - he lost everything. Had to sell up. Now he lives in a one bedroom granny flat in Winchester St. Simon doesn't have much to do with him now.        
**LISA** Oh really.        

# Page 19       

**RAEWYN** And only about six months before he lost the farm, his wife Margaret died of breast cancer. The clubs all he's got left.       
**LISA** How sad.       
**RAEWYN** And now Simon thinks he can't cope by himself anymore. He's trying to get him into a home.       
**LISA** Can't he live with Simon?       
**RAEWYN** (*Sightly annoyed*) Oh no, Simon'd far rather someone else look after him.       

*Chastity enters. Raewyn sees her and immediately asks:*       

**RAEWYN** Chastity, do you know what happened to the batch of muffins in the oven?       
**CHASTITY** Yes.       
**RAEWYN** (*Long pause as she waits for Chastity to elaborate and she doesn't*) Where are they?       
**CHASTITY** The recipe said, 'Eat immediately'.       
**RAEWYN** (*Annoyed*) They were for the team!       
**CHASTITY** Sorry.       

*Awkward silence.*       

**LISA** We haven't met. I'm Lisa.       
**CHASTITY** Hiya.       
**LISA** I'm Roger's partner.       
**CHASTITY** Oh Roger. He's gooood.       
**LISA** (*On her guard*) Yes....he is.       
**CHASTITY** I love his name.       

*Lisa is a bit shocked and doesn't know what to say.*       

**CHASTITY** He's the best in the team by a mile.       
**LISA** (*Wary*) Is he?       
**CHASTITY** He can do everything.       

# Page 20       

**RAEWYN** Deliberately butting in to stop Chastity going any further What was it you were wanting Chastity?        
**CHASTITY** On l was just going to say - eve mutin to much or one person.        
Raewyn looks unimpressed.        
**CHASTITY** Did you have a good weekend Lisa?        
**LISA** Yes I did thanks. Did you have a good weekend Chastity?        
**CHASTITY** Yes thanks.        
**LISA** Get up to much?        
**CHASTITY** I made some draft stoppers for my flat. It's quite drafty.        
**LISA** I should do that.        
**CHASTITY** Raewyn told me how.        
**LISA** (*To Raewyn*) What do you put in them?        
**RAEWYN** Rice.        
**LISA** (*Surprised*) Rice?        
**RAEWYN** Yeah. Dry rice.        
**CHASTITY** Dry. Oh. (*Pause*) I'll be back soon. (*She quickly leaves. Raewyn just looks at Lisa and shakes her head*)        
**RAEWYN** Unbelievable.        

*Silence for a few seconds as they do something.*        

**RAEWYN** Have you met all of the team yet?        
**LISA** Most of them. Steve, the twins, Scotland. A few others.        
**RAEWYN** Bruce?        
**LISA** Not really. I've seen him round.        
**RAEWYN** I like Bruce. He's a bit tight though.        
**LISA** Is he?        
**RAEWYN** Oh yeah. And he does as ile as possible. So how are things with Roger?        

# Page 21       

**LISA** I dunno. I like the way he's carefree about things but sometimes I don't like that. He just drifts along.        
**RAEWYN** He's a free spirit. Are you living with him?        
**LISA** No. His kitchen's a mess. It needs replacing. I said I wouldn't move in with him till it's done. He hasn't done it. Hasn't even started. The only thing he's serious about is robots. That and rugby.        
**RAEWYN** Robots?        
**LISA** Yeah, robotics. He's mad keen on it. Has been since he was little he says. He's always messing about in the garage, when he isn't watching        
**RAEWYN** Oh.        
**LISA** He really should be working in that area but he doesn't have any qualifications.        
**RAEWYN** Doesn't he?        
**LISA** No. There's a course he could go on but he can't afford it. It's in Oz. It's only a four month course I think but it costs thirty thousand dollars all up.        
**RAEWYN** Crikey.        
**LISA** I think it'd be just what he needs. Give him some direction.        
**RAEWYN** And you and him?        
**LISA** I don't know....Oh it's so hard... Maybe if he showed me he could actually do something we might have a future. I think we might've come to the end.        
**RAEWYN** Do you think he feels the same?        
**LISA** No.        
**RAEWYN** Oh dear. (*Looking at her watch*) Oh heavens. Do you mind finishing these up, l've got to get to ballroom dancing.        
**LISA** Ball room dancing. Sounds fun.        
**RAEWYN** Oh it is. I've been going for a couple of years. Keeps me fit.        
**LISA** Does it?        
**RAEWYN** It's surprising how much ground you cover. Great for balance and agility too - you should come along one day.        

# Page 22       

**LISA** I might just do that. I've been doing Pilates for a while - it'd be good to try something else.        
**RAEWYN** Pilates?        
**LISA** Yeah. I've had a bad back for years - all the stretching in Pilates really helps. It's pretty much come right.        
**RAEWYN** That's good. Maybe I should have a go at that too. Is it tiring?        
**LISA** No, the opposite, it gives me some energy.        
**RAEWYN** Ball room dancing's similar - I always feel good afterwards.        
**LISA** Cool.        
**RAEWYN** Anyway I'd better get going, don't want to be late for the foxtrot. Thanks for this.        
**LISA** No problem Raewyn. Have fun. See you Saturday.        

## SCENE 5        

*She can't see him. The changing rooms. Andrea has a tape measure and is measuring up the changing rooms. Bruce walks in. He has left something behind. He picks it up (a jacket perhaps) and is goes to leave but he watches her for few seconds, looking puzzled.*        

**BRUCE** Can I help you?        
**ANDREA** I don't think so.        
**BRUCE** Are you...? Umm...are you..?        
**ANDREA** (*Annoyed at being interrupted*) I'm making sure this is big enough for our foreman's hut.        
Bruce stares blankly at her.        
**BRUCE** Foreman's hut?        
**ANDREA** We're going to be building a rest... (*Quickly corrects herself*) ah a continuing care resort here.        
**BRUCE** Here?        
**ANDREA** Yes. On the playing fields.        
**BRUCE** But this is our club. I think you're in the wrong place.        

# Page 23       

**ANDREA** No.        
**BRUCE** But...but the club...        
**ANDREA** Is going to be wound up very soon. It's on its last legs isn't it.        
**BRUCE** Well...        
**ANDREA** We know you've only got one sponsor left, and if you don't get into the final, and then win it, and (*Almost laughing*) let's face it, that's never going to happen... they'll be pulling their sponsorship and that'll be that.        
**BRUCE** Ya reckon?        
**ANDREA** We'll make a reasonable offer for the land, which the Council would be mad to turn down, and we'll be building in the spring.        
**BRUCE** This is the first we've heard of it.        
**ANDREA** We're already in negotiations with the Council.        
**BRUCE** Who's 'We'?        
**ANDREA** My company. Advance Construction. (*Indicating herself*) Andrea Daphnee Vance - 'Ad-vance Construction' - clever isn't it. I'm the Director.        
**BRUCE** We don't need another rest home here.        
**ANDREA** Yes you do. The other two are full, with waiting lists. Everyone's getting older - it's wonderful isn't it!        
**BRUCE** This club's 126 years old.        
**ANDREA** It's had its day then don't you think?        
**BRUCE** No I don't. It's a big part of the community.        
**ANDREA** And our resort will be too.        
**BRUCE** You don't live here do you?        
**ANDREA** No I don't. My family have some connection to the area I think. (*There must be no reaction at all by Bruce on hearing that*) Would you like me to put you down for a unit? One or two bedrooms?        
**BRUCE** No I wouldn't. Who can I speak to about this? Who's making all the decisions?        
**ANDREA** I am. Well everything has to be approved by the Board; which I'm on. We're going to call our community 'Autumn Leaves'. Do you like it?        

# Page 24       

**BRUCE** As in, Autumn leaves and is replaced by Winter?        
**ANDREA** (*Annoyed*) Well, we haven't finalised the name yet.        
**BRUCE** I think you should leave.        
**ANDREA** I just need to look in...        
**BRUCE** No you should go.        
**ANDREA** I need to look in the kitchen.        
**BRUCE** (*Ushering her out*) Away you go.        
**ANDREA** (*As she reluctantly leaves*) What's that smell in here?        
**BRUCE** History.        

*Andrea tums up her nose and leaves.*        

**BRUCE** (*Rings Stan on his cell phone*) Stan, you better sit down.        

## SCENE 6        

*In the changing rooms. Before practice. Stan is drawing something on the whiteboard.*        

**ROGER** Gidday Stan.        
**STAN** Roger.        
**ROGER** (*Nodding his head towards the board*) Tactics?        
**STAN** I'm trying to find the best way to go up the guts.        
**ROGER** (*Dejected*) I don't think we'll have to worry about it. Vinnie broke his leg in that last tackle on Saturday.        
**STAN** Oh shit! (*Pause*) Are you sure it was his leg he broke?        
**ROGER** Yeah. Doc confirmed it on Monday.        
**STAN** Why didn't someone tell me?        
**ROGER** Dunno. Turk lost one of his front teeth but he reckons he'll be okay by the weekend. He won't be here tonight. Scotland either, he broke his nose at the start of the second half. He'll be okay though he can still breathe through one nostril. He can still play.        
**STAN** Well without Vinnie, we're done. Our second default.        

# Page 25       

**ROGER** Sorry Stan.        
**STAN** It's not your fault.        
**ROGER** We've done well to get this far without major injuries.        
**STAN** Mm.        
**ROGER** And we've got the vultures circling with that other thing.        
**STAN** The rest-home?        
**ROGER** Yeah.        
**STAN** Stupid place for a rest home anyway - right next to the cemetery.        
**ROGER** I dunno - might save time. You have a rest home, and an 'at rest' home. No, we don't want it.        
**STAN** (*Agreeing*) No we don't. The club's part of the community. We need to keep it.        
Stan is now distracted and looks worried, thinking about what this means for himself and the club. He pumps up some rugby balls. Feeling despondent.        

*Bruce enters with Martin.*        

**BRUCE** Stan this is Martin.        
**STAN** (*Barely looking up*) Gidday.        
**MARTIN** Hello. Nice to meet you.        
**BRUCE** Martin's working as a lawyer at McKenzies.        
**STAN** Oh yeah, a lawyer?        
**MARTIN** (*Pleased with himself*) It's my first job. I've just finished my degree.        
**STAN** Ah huh.        
**BRUCE** Martin's thinking he might like to play rugby.        
**STAN** (*Suddenly interested. Perks up*) is he?        
**BRUCE** He wants to get involved in the community.        

*Stan starts nodding.*        

**MARTIN** Yes that's right.        
**BRUCE** Good way to meet some new people.        

# Page 26       

**STAN** (*Nodding vigorously*) Have you played rugby before?        
**MARTIN** No.        
**STAN** (*Almost interrupting*) Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.        
**MARTIN** I played soccer at school but I've watched the odd game.        
**STAN** It's no problem.        
**MARTIN** I'm a bit shaky on the rules.        
**STAN** Who isn't. Most of the refs don't know them. Why didn't you play at school?        
**MARTIN** Oh I was a bit worried about...I was a bit worried about getting hurt.        
**STAN** (*Surprised*) Hurt?        
**MARTIN** Do many people get...?        
**STAN** (*Interrupting*) No. Not at all. The odd niggle. Isn't that right Bruce?        
**BRUCE** Ah..        
**STAN** It's very safe. Our grade's just a small step up from touch rugby really.        
Martin nods, taken in completely.        
**MARTIN** Oh that's good.        
**BRUCE** (*To Martin*) Stan's our head coach.        
**MARTIN** Have you got other coaches?        
**BRUCE** No.        
**STAN** Yes we do.        
**BRUCE** (*Unenthusiastic*) Oh that's right.        
**STAN** We've got a mental skills coach. Chastity, my granddaughter.        
**BRUCE** (*Under breath but is heard by Stan*) That's all we need.        
**STAN** (*Telling him off*) Bruce!        
**BRUCE** No I mean - that's all we need. Just two coaches.        
**STAN** Quite right. So you know Bruce do you Martin?        
**MARTIN** No we just met.       

# Page 27       

**BRUCE** He was out the front.        
**STAN** Well he'll sort you out with gear, and whatever you need. Can you do that Bruce?        
**BRUCE** Sure.        
**STAN** Have you got boots?        
**MARTIN** No.        
**STAN** What size are you?        
**MARTIN** Eight.        
**STAN** I think we've got some spare ones out the...        
**BRUCE** I'll sort it out. (*He leaves*)        
**STAN** Do you know anyone else who might be keen to play?        
**MARTIN** No sorry. I don't really know anyone. I haven't been here long.        
**STAN** Where are you from?        
**MARTIN** Dunedin.        
**STAN** Highlanders territory.        
**MARTIN** Yeah.        
**STAN** Roger's a big fan. Well we all are. Roger watches all the games though.        

*Roger comes over, and shakes Martins hand.*        

**ROGER** Gidday. Martin is it?        
**MARTIN** Yeah. Hi.        
**ROGER** Do ya go to the Highlanders games?        
**MARTIN** Some of them.        
**ROGER** I'd go to all of them if we were closer.        
**MARTIN** There have been a couple of good ones lately.        
**ROGER** Yeah I reckon we're in with a shot of the semis.        

*Bruce returns with some gear, including boots.*        

# Page 28       

**BRUCE** Try those on. There's some shorts and a jersey so you can have a run round with us tonight.        
**MARTIN** Thanks very much.        

*Everyone starts getting ready for the practice.*        

**MARTIN** So what do you do Bruce?        
**BRUCE** I work for the Council.        
**MARTIN** (*Interested*) Oh yeah.        
**BRUCE** I'm an assessor.        
**MARTIN** What do you assess?        
**BRUCE** (*Pause*) I'm not 100% sure.        
**MARTIN** Are you busy?        
**BRUCE** Yeah flat out. I only work in the mornings though.        
**MARTIN** Oh you're part time?        
**BRUCE** No. Full time.        

*Raewyn enters through main door. Everyone clearly knows her and are pleased to see her.*        

**RAEWYN** How's it going?        
**ALL** Good thanks/Good/Giday Raewyn        
**RAEWYN** Anyone want to buy a raffle for the Fire Brigade? You can win a trip to the Gold Coast.        
**STAN** How much are they?        
**RAEWYN** Twenty-five dollars.        
**STAN** Twenty-five bucks? (*A bit embarrassed that he can't afford it*) Ah no I'll pass sorry Raewyn.        

*Raewyn nods, understandingly.*        

**ROGER** Fire Brigade. Yeah I'll get one.        
**RAEWYN** Bruce? (*He deliberately ignores her*) Are you going to get one Bruce? It's for the Fire Brigade.        
**BRUCE** (*He waves his hand as if to say 'no'*)        

# Page 29       

**RAEWYN** What's that Bruce? Is that Paywave?        
**BRUCE** I'll keep an eye out for fires for them.        
**STAN** This is Martin, Raewyn. He's going to play for us. He's a lawyer.        
**RAEWYN** Is he? Nice to meet you Martin. A lawyer? You'll have plenty of money.        
**MARTIN** Not really. 'll get one though.        
**RAEWYN** Very good of you. There's some sausage rolls in the kitchen for after practice if anyone wants them.        
**ALL** Great/Cheers        
**RAEWYN** No problem.        

*Raewyn leaves via side door.*        

**STAN** Right, listen up, I need you to do some intervals.        

*General moaning*        

**BRUCE** Oh do we have to?        
**STAN** We need you to get fitter than the other teams, that's pretty obvious from our first few games. We need a point of difference from them.        
**ROGER** Aren't we getting that with our mental skills coach?        
**BRUCE** Yeah I think maybe we should do the intervals.        
**MARTIN** Intervals?        
**STAN** Yeah, so you start lying face down on the try line, then sprint to the 22 and back, then to the half way and back, then to the other 22 and back and so on. You do that ten times. Someone use a stop watch and the others can do the running.        
**EVERYONE** (*EXCEPT MARTIN and EXTRA 1*) I'll use the watch!        
**STAN** Then you swap over.        
**EVERYONE** (*EXCEPT MARTIN and EXTRA 1*) Oh.        
**STAN** Has anyone got a watch?        
**EVERYONE** (*EXCEPT MARTIN and EXTRA 1*) No.        
**STAN** (*Suspicious*) Is that right? Okay use mine. (*He hands it to Bruce*).        

# Page 30       

**BRUCE** (*To Roger*) I've got one of those new Apple watches. I left it at home. It does all sorts of useful things - it can tell when l'm ovulating. (*Smiles*)       
**MARTIN** (*Seeing the watch. Impressed*) A Rolex.       
**STAN** Don't lose it. My father gave it to me for my 210. It's worth 40K.       
**MARTIN** Woah. (*To Bruce*) Who'd pay 40K for a watch?       

**STAN** (*Overhearing*) It's worth every cent. It's all I've got from my Dad. (*To Bruce*) l've just gotta shoot down and pick up the new post guards.       
**ROGER** We're getting new ones?       
**STAN** No, second hand. Blues got some new ones. Can you look after the practice till I'm back Bruce?       
**BRUCE** No worries.       
**STAN** Do some handling drills when you've done the intervals, and put down some scrums will ya. I should be back by then.       
**BRUCE** Okay.       

*The players get up and leave to practice. Stan leaves at the same time. Lights down briefly to indicate passage of time. Sound effects of rugby practice.*       
*When the lights come up everyone is sitting down, quiet, downcast. Stan enters.*       

**STAN** (*Surprised to see them all there*) What's the story, you can't be done yet? (*No one says anything*) What's wrong?       
**BRUCE** We lost your watch.       
**STAN** (*Shocked and clearly upset but trying not to show it*) How?       
**BRUCE** I forgot where I put it down. We looked everywhere. Sorry Stan. I'll go again tomorrow when it's light.       
**STAN** Which field?       
**BRUCE** We were on both of them. I'm not sure where I put it. The trouble is they're so bloody muddy. I think it sunk.       

*Stan looks upset. He goes to say something but stops.*       

**MARTIN** It was me Stan.       
**BRUCE** (*Trying to stop him*) Martin!       

# Page 31       

**MARTIN** (*Shakes his head at Bruce*) Bruce gave it to me to look after. I'm so sorry. I put it down somewhere and I got caught up in the practice and what I was supposed to be doing... (*Pause*) Was it insured?       
**STAN** No. (*Softly*) It's not really the... money.       
**MARTIN** (*Feeling awful*) No. I'm really sorry. I feel awful.       
**STAN** (*Pulling himself together but clearly still upset*) It's alright Martin; don't worry about it. The important thing is you're here, and you're part of the team.       

*Martin looks at Bruce clearly feeling terrible.*       

**STAN** Right, we've got a game to win. There's a chance we can sneak into third, to avoid Woodbridge in the semi-final but we need a good result this weekend. We've got Pirates. It's an away game. (*At the whiteboard*) Now I've been studying their form. I reckon we've got every chance of winning. They tend to fall off tackles in the midfield, so what we're going to do is go up the guts, pile in over the top, making sure we keep our feet, clear the pill, then spin it wide.       

*Everyone is nodding. Chastity enters wearing hotpants. Martin is very taken with her and just stares.*       

**STAN** Oh Chastity, good timing. You look tired love.       
**EXTRA 2** Been up and down all night probably. (*Extra 3 sniggers*)       

*Stan glares at the extra who spoke.*       

**STAN** We're going to do some ball skills shortly and (*Addressed to Chastity*) then do you think you could do some mental skills work with the boys? We've got a big game on Saturdee.       
**CHASTITY** Umm I could help with the ball skills.       
**EXTRA 2** Ooo yeah.       
**STAN** (*Angry. To the Extra*) You're dropped!       
**BRUCE** (*Whispering to Stan*) You can't drop him - we haven't got enough players!       
**STAN** (*To Extra 2*) You're not dropped but you're not top of the pops either. Chastity? How about we go straight into those mental skills?       
**CHASTITY** (*Reluctant*) Umm I'm supposed to be getting a facial.       

*Stan looks at Extra 2 but doesn't say anything to him. Then tums to Chastity.*       

# Page 32       

**STAN** We need to work on our mental skills now.        
**CHASTITY** (*Trying to get out of it*) I think I might have a friend coming round.        
**STAN** We really need your help Chastity.        
**CHASTITY** My goldfish is unwell:        
**STAN** Please poppet.        
**CHASTITY** (*Reluctant*) Oh alright, but l've got to be home to watch Love Island at eight.        
**STAN** Yep. Gather round everyone. (*They do*) Do you need the white board?        
**CHASTITY** No. (*Suddenly changes demeanour totally and is smart and articulate, as she addresses the players. There is a long silence to begin with as it doesn't look like she knows what to say*) What I will be talking about is a deliberate and systematic practice of strategies and methodologies, sometimes referred to as psychological rehabilitation, designed to enhance and maximize your onfield performance. (*Bruce tums his head towards Roger, mouth open, clearly shocked by how smart Chastity sounds*) What you are about to find yourselves in the midst of is what we call a 'Critical Performance Situation' or C.P.S. Other similar Critical Performance Situations which all of you may well find yourselves in and which immediately spring to mind as the most common are; conducting a symphony orchestra, performing brain surgery or landing a space ship. (*Bruce shakes his head as he realises he was very wrong to think she was smart, and is taking it back*) In order to deal with these situations effectively you need to be thinking about these four pillars of the CPS framework: Strategy, Harmony, Industry, and Teamwork. S.H.I. T. (*Deadpan*) You need to be thinking about Shit. (*Then to Stan*) I think that's about enough for one day Pops I don't want them to get bogged down,.        
**STAN** Oh okay. Thanks very much Chastity. That was excellent. Wasn't it boys?        
**ALL** (*Unenthusiastic*) Yeah/YepVery helpful.        
**STAN** That's it for tonight then lads. Good luck for Saturdee. Green and Gold (*Everyone joins in*) all the way! Green and gold we'll have our day!! Remember Pirates have got some big boys. And two or three Rep players. Hard tacklers.        
**EXTRA 1** starts to open his mouth to complain but because Stan has previously told him not to speak Stan puts is finger up and shakes his head as if to say 'don't say anything', and the Extra stops himself.        

# Page 33       

**STAN** Just do your best.        

*Martin speaks to Bruce as the others are getting ready to leave, including Chastity.*        

**MARTIN** She's beautiful isn't she?        
**BRUCE** Chastity?        
**MARTIN** Yeah.        
**BRUCE** Lovely name. (*Pause. Then giving him some friendly advice*) She's been around the block a few times Martin.        

*Martin nods, understanding.*        

**MARTIN** Do you think she might be interested in me?        
**BRUCE** Parts of you maybe        
**STAN** Now hit those showers boys. And start thinking about Chastity. (*Then realising they might misconstrue what he has said*) About what she said! And remember to come through the gate on Saturdee.       
**BRUCE** (*To Roger*) Got anything planned for after the game?        
**ROGER** I've gotta find something for the kids to do where they won't bump into Lisa...or need any supervision... probably the pool.        
**BRUCE** You need to tell her Roger.        
**ROGER** Why? Do you think it's wrong to keep something like that a secret?        
**BRUCE** No, I just think she might find out some other way.        
**ROGER** Yeah probably right... (*Still undecided*)...oh I dunno, it's been so good.        
**STAN** Come on fellas - you need to get your beauty sleep.        

*Everyone leaves, followed by Stan who is the last out. He picks up a big torch and walks out, clearly going to look for the watch.*        
*Lights down to indicate end of scene and passage of time.*        

## SCENE 7        

*In the changing room. A few days after the away game. A practice. Everyone is sitting around dejected Stan enters on crutches.*        

**BRUCE** What happened to you?        

# Page 34       

**STAN** Tripped over a pot plant. I'm fine.        
**BRUCE** What've you done?        
**STAN** Sprained ankle; bit of bruising on the hip. Nothing.        
**BRUCE** Did you have to go to hospital?        
**STAN** Yeah. I was on the floor for about an hour - couldn't reach my bloody phone. Finally managed to get it and rang Roger. He took me. Thanks again for that fella.        
**ROGER** No worries Stan.        
**STAN** So what happened in the game? It didn't go too well?        
**BRUCE** We were leading at the end of the first half. Dominated most of the second. Martin made some good tackles.        
**STAN** Great stuff.        
**BRUCE** Well they sort of fell over him when he lost his balance in front of them We had a bad last ten. Roger scored a beaut try but Steve got penalised for a dangerous tackle - he got a yellow card. They kicked the penalty. Then I got penalised for playing the ball on the ground. They kicked that too. Then Martin got penalised out in front for coming in from the side. They took the shot and that was it. Fulltime, 24 - 23 to them.        
**STAN** Bugger. You didn't come through the gate Martin?        
**MARTIN** I couldn't find the gate - I had to jump over the fence.        
**ROGER** Our set piece was pretty good.        
**STAN** How did you deal with the breakdown?        
**MARTIN** Oh the team bus? No I drove up there by myself. The others got it going eventually.        
**STAN** (*Shaking his head at Martins lack of understanding*) Never mind. Any injuries?        
**BRUCE** Nothing serious.        
**STAN** Thank God.        
**ROGER** I nearly scored in the last minute Stan but I lost my balance running down the touch line.        

# Page 35       

**STAN** Sounds like something Bruce'd do. (*Bruce glances at him, not too happy*) What are you guys doing out there - can't you stay on your feet?        
**BRUCE** (*In reference to Stan's injury*) Huh.        
**ROGER** Where does it leave us on the table?        
**STAN** Well the bonus point was all we needed.        
**MARTIN** We haven't won a game yet.        
**STAN** Doesn't matter. With all our bonus points we're actually one ahead of Blues. So we finished third in the round robin.        
**MARTIN** Is that good?        
**BRUCE** Yes. It means we don't have to play Woodbridge in the semi. They're the top team so they play the bottom.        
**STAN** We'll have Pirates again. Still not easy but better than Woodbridge. And we're gonna be playing at home - Pirates ground's flooded again; so that's a bonus.        
**MARTIN** There has been a lot of rain lately.        
Roger is reading a magazine and shows it to Martin.        
**ROGER** Check that out - a robot arm that can operate on impulses from the human brain. Artificial Intelligence. I'd love to be able to help build those. Probably not the Al side but the engineering.        
**MARTIN** Do you know how to do that?        
**STAN** Put it away Roger - we've got a game to be thinking about.        
**ROGER** (*As he is putting the magazine away*) (*Speaking quickly*) There's a course in Melbourne - only one in the world teaching this stuff. Cutting edge.        
**MARTIN** Can't you go?        
**STAN** Roger!        
**ROGER** Sorry. (*To Martin*) Can't afford it. Have to stick with my day job.        
**STAN** You guys need to be doing some running this week. Gotta keep that fitness up. And get into the gym.        
**BRUCE** It's getting a bit boring Stan.        

# Page 36       

**STAN** Oh I'm sorry. I'll get a couple of marching girls and a brass band to cheer you along! Do you want to win the Grinder Cup or not?        
**BRUCE** Isn't there something else we could do?        
**STAN** No. Weights and Ks is all you need.        
**BRUCE** I'm not as flexible as I was. I can't stretch my arm more than this. (*Puts his arm up but not completely straight*)        
**STAN** Have a hot shower before you play. Right we'll start with some treadmill work tonight. Then we'll do some lineouts.        
**ROGER** (*Excited*) Have we got treadmills?        
**STAN** Umm. No. Everyone come over here. (*They do*) Now start walking.        
**BRUCE** Walking?        
**STAN** Yeah. On the spot. Just imagine the treadmills. (*They walk up and down on the spot*) Good. Now we're going up a hill. (*Everyone leans forward as if they were walking up a steep hill*) Keep going. I'll get the balls. (*He leaves briefly*)        
**MARTIN** (*To Roger*) Why doesn't Stan come to our games?        
**ROGER** He's not allowed. He can still coach us but he's not allowed on the field or even the side-line.        
**MARTIN** Why not?        
**BRUCE** Last year when Reverend Campbell told the Ref he should be crucified Stan went back to his truck to get his nail gun - and ran out onto the field with it!        
**STAN** (*Overhearing the last bit*) There was a misunderstanding. I was trying to give him his Makita back.        
**BRUCE** The Judicial Committee didn't see it like that.        
**STAN** No. Six month ban from all rugby and not to be on the side-lines for twelve months.        
**BRUCE** At least you could still watch rugby on TV.        
**STAN** No, had to get rid of SKY when my rent went up again. Here, can you help me with these balls Roger? Alright fellas you can get off the treadmills - we'll do more at the end of practice as a warm down.        

# Page 37       

*Extra 1 opens his mouth to say something about that but Stan shuts him down by waggling his finger at him, and shaking his head.*        
*Roger goes to help Stan. Bruce is looking a bit down in the mouth. He sighs loudly. Martin notices.*       

**MARTIN** Are you okay Bruce?        
**BRUCE** It's nice of you to ask Martin. Winter's a difficult time for me.        
**MARTIN** Why's that?        
**BRUCE** It's my wife, Lynette.        
**MARTIN** Is she unwell?        
**BRUCE** The thing is we've got a metal roof, and Lynette... well...let's just say she likes the sound of rain on the roof.        
**MARTIN** (*Not getting what he's implying*) She likes the sound of rain on the roof?        
**BRUCE** Yeah. At night.        
**MARTIN** (*Still not getting it*) At night? She likes the sound of rain on the roof at night?        
**BRUCE** It makes her...you know. (*No response from Martin. Giving up trying to skirt around*) She gets horny from the sound of rain on the roof! (*Voice wavering*)        
**MARTIN** Oh right.        
**BRUCE** She can be very demanding. And this month we've had a record rainfall -I'm exhausted! I don't know if I can go on playing.        
**MARTIN** Oh you have to Bruce, we need you to.        
**BRUCE** Well pray for a drought!        
**MARTIN** You know some men would say you'll pretty lucky.        
**BRUCE** I'm not interested in sex anymore Martin. I get more pleasure out of finding a park in the middle of town.        

*Stan addresses the team.*        

**STAN** Come on you lot, let's get out there. Let's see some energy. Bruce, you look shagged. (*Bruce glances at Martin*)        

*Bruce drags himself off the seat.*        

# Page 38       

**STAN** I need you all to be giving it 110% this weekend.        
Bruce looks worried.        
**MARTIN** (*Has been looking at has phone. To Bruce, encouraging*) I's gong lo be fine on Saturday Bruce.        
**BRUCE** (*Bruce nods*) What about Friday night?        
**MARTIN** (*Reluctant to say*) Rain.        

*Bruce looks aghast.*        
*Lights down for the end of scene and to indicate the passage of time.*        

## SCENE 8        

*Andrea is in the kitchen with a clipboard poking around. Testing the plugs and taps etc. Stan enters but doesn't see her at first.*        

**STAN** Sorry I didn't see you there. From the Council are you? (*She doesn't answer but smiles slightly, and he just assumes she is a council hygiene inspector*) It's a bit dated. It was put in in the eighties. Trevor Beuly and Jock Ross did it in one weekend.        
**ANDREA** (*Not overly interested*) Really?        
**STAN** Trevor was a plumber in town for years, and Jock was a bit of a handyman.        
**ANDREA** And nothings been done to it since the eighties?        
**STAN** (*Defensive*) No, but it's always clean, Raewyn keeps it spotless. Does a bloody good job - all the ladies do.        
**ANDREA** Everything works all right?        
**STAN** Yeah she's good as gold.        
**ANDREA** (*To herself*) Hot water and an oven's about all we need.        
**STAN** What's that?        
**ANDREA** (*Realising she has nearly spilt the beans*) Oh nothing.        
**STAN** You know some outfit wanna build a rest home here.        
**ANDREA** Do they?        

# Page 39       

**STAN** Yeah. Just heard about it the other day. On our club grounds. They're already in talks with the Council - probably not your department. (*Andrea says nothing*) It's unbelievable. I've been coming here since I was five.        
**ANDREA** There is quite a demand for rest. (*About to say 'rest-homes' but stops herself...*) homes for the elder.. places for people in the latter stage of their lives.        
**STAN** Yeah that's fine, just not on our club grounds. Once it's gone, you can't get it back.        
**ANDREA** (*Showing a moment of perception*) Like youth I suppose.        
**STAN** Here you might as well have this. I've got a couple of spare copies.        
**ANDREA** Oh what's this?        
**STAN** It's the complete history of the club. I wrote it for the 125th. The Council should have one.        
**ANDREA** I'll make sure they get it.        
**STAN** (*Briefly wonders why she said that if she works there, but says nothing about that*) Took me four years to write. A labour of love I guess - but don't tell anyone that. I've leave you to it. (*He leaves*)        

*Lights go down to indicate end of scene and passage of time.*        

## SCENE 9        

*A few days later. In the kitchen before the semi. Roger enters with some garden flowers for Raewyn who is in there.*        

**ROGER** There you go Raewyn.        
**RAEWYN** Oh thanks Roger. They're lovely.        
**ROGER** Just getting ready for the game.        
**RAEWYN** All the best.        

*Roger goes through to the changing room. Stan comes in to fill water bottles.*        

**STAN** Gidday Raewyn.        
**RAEWYN** Hi Stan. Big day?        
**STAN** Yeah she's all on the line today.        

# Page 40       

**RAEWYN** I'm sure they'll do well.        
**STAN** We'll give it our best shot. We have to, to get into the final.        
**RAEWYN** You got a full team?        
**STAN** Yep. Just. We can't afford any injuries though.        

*Bruce enters in is rugby gear, looking exhausted. Very scruffy, hair messed up. He walks bow-legged and staggering.*        

**STAN** (*To Bruce*) What happened to you?        
**BRUCE** (*Can hardly speak*) Raining...raining.        

*Bruce leans on the bench, exhausted.*        

**STAN** What are you on about?        
**BRUCE** Torrential... torrential.        
**STAN** No, it's fine out there.        
**BRUCE** Last night. Energy...energy...energy drink.        
**STAN** Get him a drink could you Raewyn. (*Concerned*) What have you been doing Bruce?        
**BRUCE** Everything!        

*Raewyn hands Stan an energy drink which he gives to Bruce.*        

**STAN** Drink this. We need you out there today Bruce.        

*Bruce sculls the drink.*        

**STAN** Deep breaths.        
**BRUCE** Yep.        
**STAN** What the hell? (*Takes some handcuffs off one of Bruce's hands*) (*Looks at Bruce sceptically*) You need to be preserving your energy before a big match.        
**BRUCE** It bloody rained!        

*Stan looks totally confused. Lisa enters.*        

**LISA** Hi.        
**RAEWYN** Lisa. Have you met Bruce yet?        

# Page 41       

**LISA** No I haven't. Hello.        
**RAEWYN** He's just catching his breath. He's been....busy.        
**BRUCE** (*Having caught his breath and pulled himself together*) Gidday. You're Roger's partner?        
**LISA** Yes. (*Under breath, but Bruce hears*) At the moment.        

*Stan and Raewyn move away to do something.*        

**BRUCE** I've got a lot of time for Roger. He's a good kid.. kids are good...d like kids.        
**LISA** (*Not sure what he's getting at*) Do you?        
**BRUCE** I mean I've got a couple of my own.        
**LISA** Right.        
**BRUCE** Have you...?        
**LISA** No.        
**BRUCE** No. No plans?        
**LISA** Not at the moment.        
**BRUCE** Yeah there's no point in plans with kids... sometimes they can just.. be a surprise. (*Pause*) Yeah kids are great. So what do you do Lisa?        
**LISA** I'm a Change Manager at Work and Income. What about you Bruce?        
**BRUCE** I'm a 'Stay The Same Manager' at the Council. (*Pause*) No, I'm an assessor there. A Geotech assessor.        
**LISA** Sounds interesting.        
**BRUCE** Not really.        
**STAN** Oh there was a woman from the Council in here the other day Raewyn.        
**RAEWYN** Was there?        
**STAN** Hygiene check I'm guessing. She didn't actually say.        
**RAEWYN** Weird. We weren't notified. Normally they give us some warning.        
**STAN** You right now Bruce?        
**BRUCE** (*Nods*) Did she have short dark hair?        

# Page 42       

**STAN** Who?        
**BRUCE** The woman you saw.        
**STAN** I think she might've.        
**BRUCE** Black framed glasses?        
**STAN** Yeah.        
**BRUCE** Clipboard?        
**STAN** Yeah.        
**BRUCE** That was Andrea Vance - the rest home lady.        
**STAN** What was she doing here?        
**BRUCE** gonna use the clubrooms while they build the rest home. She'll've been checking out the kitchen for the contractors. They're        
**STAN** Bloody hell! - I gave her copy of my book!        
**BRUCE** I caught her snooping around again yesterday. She was measuring up the fields.        
**STAN** Arghh. Can't she just leave us alone.        
**RAEWYN** She's certainly keen to get rid of us.        
**STAN** At least we're safe for the season.        
**BRUCE** I dunno. If we get knocked out today she might try and bring it forward.        
**STAN** We'll still have the clubrooms to use. You can't build an outfit like that in five minutes.        
**RAEWYN** No.        
**BRUCE** I wouldn't be so sure, she said they're going to use Chinese labourers. She reckons they'll be able to build the lot in twelve weeks!        
**STAN** Bloody hell! Chinese labourers. (*Long pause*) Do they play rugby? (*Pause*) No our season'll be done by then. (*Pause*) I don't know what I'll do we if lose the club. (*Bruce pats him on the shoulder*)        
**RAEWYN** It'll be alright Stan. If we win the final, we'll be set for another year at least - the Council won't touch us. Election's coming up.        
**STAN** (*Not sounding convinced*) Yeah. Just win the final. We gotta win the semi first!        

# Page 43       

*Stan moves to one side to do something. He is able to hear what is said next but there is to be no indication to the audience that he has heard.*        

**RAEWYN** (*To Bruce*) You've heard about this course Roger wants to do - robotics?        
**BRUCE** Yeah. In Oz. Bloody expensive.        
**RAEWYN** It's all included though - accommodation and airfares and everything. (*Pause*) It'd be good to see him make something of himself - might even help him hold onto Lisa.        
**BRUCE** (*As if to say 'What are you getting at?'*) Yeah.        
**RAEWYN** He'll never get there by himself.        
**BRUCE** *(Looking worried*) No.        
**RAEWYN** How about we help him out? Raise some money for him? We'll do it through the club.        
**BRUCE** (*Silent for a few seconds*) Yeah. Good idea Raewyn. I'll start the ball rolling - I'll donate two hundred and fifty bucks.        
**RAEWYN** (*Surprised*) Oh Bruce, that's very good of you.        
**BRUCE** (*Indignant*) You see - I'm not tight!        
**RAEWYN** Never said you were. (*Bruce gestures towards Stan as if to say 'you could ask Stan for a donation', and Raewyn shakes her head as she is aware of his financial position*)        
**STAN** You ready Bruce? We need to go through? Where's Chasity? She was gonna do some more work with you blokes.        
**BRUCE** (*To Lisa*) Nice to meet you.        
**LISA** You too.        
**RAEWYN** Good luck!        
**STAN** Thanks Raewyn.        
**RAEWYN** I'll have plenty of potato top pies waiting for you at the end of the game.        
**STAN** Cheers.        

*They go through into the changing rooms to get ready for the semi. The other players are there.*        

**STAN** Good to see you Martin. Keen for a big one?        

# Page 44       

**MARTIN** Yes I certainly am.        
**STAN** Have you scored yet?        
**MARTIN** No.        
**STAN** Maybe today eh?        
**MARTIN** Hopefully.        

*Stan moves on to someone else. Martin speaks to Roger.*        

**MARTIN** Roger?        
**ROGER** Yeah.        
**MARTIN** You know I have never umm...never... scored... you know, with a girl.        
**ROGER** I wouldn't worry about it, there's not a time limit.        
**MARTIN** I sometimes wonder what it's like.        
**ROGER** (*Feeling a bit uncomfortable*) I'Il get Bruce to tell you about it. He's got a lot of experience in that area. (*Martin nods*)        

*Lisa comes in and gets Roger's attention.*        

**LISA** Here's your mouth-guard.        
**ROGER** Thanks.        
**LISA** Have a good game. (*She is about to leave*)        
**ROGER** Lisa. I'm glad you're here. I need to tell you something.        
**LISA** What is it?        
**ROGER** I've got...l've got...l've got two... l've got two...l've got two...        
**LISA** Two what?        
**ROGER** I've got to go to the toilet. Sore stomach. (*He wanders off to the loo*)        

*Lisa leaves, dissatisfied.*        
*Bruce takes Stan to one side.*        

**BRUCE** (*Concemed*) Stan I don't want to pry, but are you okay.... you know. money wise?        
**STAN** Yeah I'm fine. I've got a little bit of land in Wanaka.        
**BRUCE** (*Satisfied*) Oh okay.        

# Page 45       

**STAN** (*Indicating the extras*) I better talk to these jokers.       

*Bruce nods and walks away.*       

**STAN** Just get the pill to Roger. Okay.       

*Extra 1 opens his mouth to say something but Stan shuts him dow*n       

**STAN** Ah! To Roger. (*The extras nod*)       

*Raewyn enters with the water bottles.*       

**RAEWYN** You'll need these.       

*Bruce has a quiet word with Raewyn away from Stan.*       

**BRUCE** Stan's fine - I think he'll be able to make a contribution for Roger.       
**RAEWYN** He hasn't got two pennies to rub together.       
**BRUCE** No he's got some land in Wanaka. He just told me.       
**RAEWYN** Did he say it was 'a little bit of land'?       
**BRUCE** (*Thinking*) Yeah - a little bit of land.       
**RAEWYN** That's right - it's a family plot in the Wanaka cemetery!       
**BRUCE** Oh.       

*Raewyn leaves.*       

**CHASTITY** Hiya! Sorry I'm late. Got stuck in rough hour traffic.       
**BRUCE** It's 'rush hour'.       
**CHASTITY** Is it? No.       
**BRUCE** It is. We don't even have rush hour here.       
**CHASTITY** Okay - I was getting a manicure.       

*Roger pokes his head out to make sure Lisa has left and then comes back and sits down. He spies Martin staring at Chastity.*       

**ROGER** (*To Martin*) Why don't you go and say hello?       
**MARTIN** I wouldn't know what else to say.       
**ROGER** Don't worry - it'll just come to you.       
**MARTIN** You think so?       

# Page 46       

**ROGER** For sure mate. It's nature. It's like instinct or something, it'll just happen.       
**MARTIN** Okay.       
**ROGER** And who knows what else might happen. (*Smiles at Martin who smirks back*)       
**MARTIN** (*Reluctantly he goes over to Chastity*) I'm Martin.       

*Chasity puts out her incorrect hand (ie left) to shakes his, and he has put out his rig so he has to swap hands but she does as well so they end up with their hands crossed over and shaking both hands, awkwardly. Martin then stands there not knowing what to say. Uncomfortable silence. He desperately looks at Roger for help but Roger just shrugs. Martin then just sheepishly walks back to his seat. Everyone else is just sitting around chatting (quietly so the audience can't hear).*       

**STAN** Come on you lot - let's get focused on the game! Chastity, what were you gonna say to the fellas?       

*Chastity starts walking around the changing room as she speaks.*       

**CHASTITY** (*It starts off sounding like a motivational speech but quickly changes and she becomes forceful*) When I stand her today, this special day, this day that could go down in the history of the Valley Club as a momentous day, look around and I see a group of players from all different walks of life, from all different backgrounds, brought together in this cauldron with one common goal, one object that you are striving for with every fibre of your being, no matter what challenges and obstacles are put in your way, and it has become crystal clear to me over the last few weeks that you are all, without exception... a bunch of total losers!       

*Stan is clearly shocked by what Chastity has said, as are the players.*       

**CHASTITY** (*Continuing*) Look at the state of you! Overweight, out of shape, unfit, you're an embarrassment to the club. Can't catch, can't tackle, you're bunch of utter halfwits! (*Pause*) Dropping the ball, tripping over your own feet, you're a joke; a laughing stock.       
**RAEWYN** (*To Stan, from the doorway*) They need you out there guys! They're ready for kick off.       

*The team gets up looking a bit dazed and confused. They trudge out with heads down. Martin is the last to leave.*       

**STAN** Remember Martin you must keep your feet.       

# Page 47       

**MARTIN** You mean my boots?        
**STAN** No, your feet. You have to keep your feet.        
**MARTIN** Well I will - my boots won't be much use without them.        

*Stan shakes his head.*        

**STAN** (*Yelling after them*) Good luck. No cards! Look after the pill! (*Tuming to Chastity. Irate*) What the hell was that Chastity?!! You were s'posed to be revving them up not bringing them down!        
**CHASTITY** Sorry. It was my session on coping with criticism. I ran out of time! (*Pause*) We didn't get to do the strategies.        

*Stan puts his head in his hands in exasperation.        
Lights down for end of first half.*        

## INTERMISSION       

## SCENE 10       

*The team comes into the changing room for half time in the semi-final.*        

**STAN** What's happening out there?        
**MARTIN** We're being thrashed.        
**BRUCE** It's 20 to 3. We got one penalty.        
**ROGER** It's gonna be a big score.        
**MARTIN** We're missing too many tackles.        
**BRUCE** My dear old grandmother had a saying that's quite appropriate for this situation.        
**ROGER** What's that?        
**BRUCE** Our family motto. She drilled it into us relentlessly, for years. If at first you don't succeed...give up.        
**STAN** (*Annoyed*) Bruce!        
**MARTIN** It's hard going Stan.        
**BRUCE** We don't look like scoring.        

# Page 48       

**CHASTITY** You should have some confidence. (*They all look at her with distain*)        
**STAN** No she's right. It's not all over yet. You're only a couple of converted tries away; it's nothing. We can do this.        
**MARTIN** We don't seem to be able to get through their defence. There's too many of them.        
**STAN** Same number as you've got. Just keep at it. How's the ref going?        
**ROGER** He's being a prick to both sides.        
**STAN** Well that's all you can ask. (*Silence for a few seconds*) Go to the loo i you need to. Keep hydrated.        
**MARTIN** Going to the loo won't make us hydrated, it'll make us dehydrated.        
**STAN** No, I mean go to the loo if you need a pee but also have a drink if you need to.        
**MARTIN** You should have said that.        
**STAN** (*Frustrated*) You are a lawyer aren't you Martin.        
Martin nods, and goes off to the loo.        
**ROGER** (*To Bruce. Trying to recall what Martin wanted to know about*) Martin was wondering....oh he wanted me to ask you something. (*Pause*) No it's gone.        

*Roger gets up and moves away, looking at some texts on his phone. Stan comes over to Bruce.*       

**STAN** Bruce.        
**BRUCE** Yeah.        
**STAN** I think Martin's enthusiasm's flagging. We need to gee him up a bit. He's never scored a try - can you have a word. Tell him what it's like score one - we need him to have something to aim for. Can ya? (*Bruce nods*) I better have a word with the forwards. (*He moves away*)        
**ROGER** (*Has come back over to Bruce. Looking at his phone*) Lisa thinks l'm acting strangely.        
**BRUCE** Are you?        
**ROGER** No I always act like this. (*Gets another text. Freaked out*) She just said I always act like this!        
**BRUCE** Do you think she can read your mind?        

# Page 49       

**ROGER** (*Worried*) She better bloody not. (*Pause*) She'll find out a shitload. (*Pause*) She's ringing.        

*Roger leaves.*       

**ROGER** Hello. Oh it's you.        

*Martin returns and sits next to Bruce.*        

**BRUCE** You haven't got across the line yet Martin?        
**MARTIN** (*Embarrassed*) No. I haven't got anywhere near the line. Roger said you'd tell me about it.        
**BRUCE** (*He doesn't know what Martin is talking about, and begins telling Martin about scoring a try, but Martin thinks he is telling him about sex*) If you haven't done it before - you'll find it's the most amazing thing.        
**MARTIN** (*Biting his knuckle*) I thought it might be.        
**BRUCE** You might be a bit nervous to begin with. That's normal - it's a big occasion. Maybe you've missed an opportunity earlier.        
**MARTIN** I guess.        
**BRUCE** Maybe just fumbled.        
**MARTIN** Yes.        
**BRUCE** There's likely to be a tangle of bodies to begin with. Just be patient. If you're lucky there'll be small gap - it'll just open up in front of you and you just go for it. You may have to go all the way.        
**MARTIN** I want go all the way.        
**BRUCE** You've just gotta go hard.        
**MARTIN** I will be.        
**BRUCE** The grass has been mowed so that'll make things easier. (*Martin appears confused*) There'll be lots of yelling - 'Keep Going!, Keep going!, Don't Stop! Don't Stop....Stay in!' To you it'll feel like a long time but in reality it'll just be a few seconds. And then you get there, and you just collapse, exhausted. And that's it. You'll feel pretty happy with yourself afterwards but don't go doing any of those stupid moves. (*He puts his arms out as if he's flying, and then points to the sky as if signalling to God, like rugby plays do after scoring tries*)        
**MARTIN** Will I remember it?        

# Page 50       

**BRUCE** Sure.but you can always watch the video later.        
**MARTIN** (*Shocked*) It'll be filmed?        
**BRUCE** Yeah someone'll film it. (*Gets up to leave and taps Martin on the leg*) We might even get the whole team together to watch it.        

*Martin, open mouthed. Shocked.*        

**STAN** Right come on you lot - stay focused.        

*Roger speaks to Bruce.*        
**ROGER** (*Worried*) She wants to see me after the game.        

*Lights down to indicate end of scene and passage of time.*        

## SCENE 11        

*The team comes into the changing room after full time in the semi-final. Stan is patting them on the back as they enter.*        

**STAN** Well done! Great job fellas.        
**BRUCE** Cheers.        
**MARTIN** Thanks Stan.        
**STAN** How d'you do it?        
**MARTIN** Roger. He scored two tries, got both conversions, and he got a penalty and a drop goal!        
**STAN** Yeah I could see some of it over people's heads. Terrific!        
**MARTIN** And we kept them scoreless in that half.        
**STAN** Amazing - I thought you'd run out of puff.        
**MARTIN** No, our training helped out there.        
**STAN** Good stuff!        
**BRUCE** We did have a bit of luck though.        
**STAN** You mean the cards?        
**BRUCE** It was fifteen on thirteen for most of that half. They got one red and a yellow.        

# Page 51       

**MARTIN** Yeah was that really fair?        
**STAN** Wash your mouth out Martin - of course it was!        
**MARTIN** Shouldn't it be an even playing field?        
**STAN** No. Those are the rules. We all live by them. You should know that.        
**MARTIN** It just doesn't feel right.        
**STAN** Don't worry about feelings - do you want to win the Grinder Cup or not?        
**MARTIN** Yep.        
**STAN** Well then.        
**EXTRA 2** I think we played our best game of the season.        
**ALL** Yeah/We did.        
**MARTIN** There were some scouts watching us.        
**EXTRA 2** Really?        
**STAN** Probably from some Aussie league clubs.        
**BRUCE** I don't think so - there were with some Girl Guides with them.        
**STAN** Oh.        

*Roger enters.*        

**ROGER** STAN! STAN! I've found your watch!        
**STAN** (*Absolutely overwhelmed with relief*) Oh Roger! Thank God. Where was it?        
**ROGER** It was on the number two field. I just saw something glinting when I was walking across.        
**STAN** Thank you Roger. Thank you so much fella. That's wonderful. You've made my day. And well done for such a great game!        
**ROGER** Cheers Stan.        
**STAN** You guys'll all be able to relax tonight. You deserve it. We're through to the final!! I can almost smell the Grinder Cup!        
**ROGER** That's probably Bruce. (*Pause*) So we'll have a few beers and watch the Highlanders in the semis!        

# Page 52       

**BRUCE** Yeah great.        
**MARTIN** That on tonight?        
**ROGER** Yeah. In Wellington.        
**MARTIN** Should be a good game.        
**ROGER** Oh mate it will be - wouldn't miss it.        
**BRUCE** We'll go to The Whitehouse shall we? You'll come Martin?        
**MARTIN** I don't drink.        
**BRUCE** You can still watch the game.        

*Raewyn, Chastity and Lisa enter.*        

**RAEWYN** Well done guys that was an amazing second half. You were all over them.        
**STAN** It'll be a step up next week.        
**RAEWYN** Well that's next week.        
**STAN** What'd you think Chasity?        
**CHASTITY** I thought you were much better dressed than the other team. (*Then to Martin, sensually*) I think your handling was really good Martin - you've got such soft hands.        

*Martin is a little taken aback and smiles to himself.*        

**CHASTITY** (*Continues*) And the way you bounced up after that guy ran over the top of you. You just popped straight up. (*She is holding a water bottle when she says that, and moves it from horizontal to vertical*)       

*Lisa takes Roger to one side.*        

**LISA** We need to talk Roger.        
**ROGER** Why's that?        
**LISA** We just do.        
**ROGER** Okay, whenever you want.        
**LISA** Tonight.        
**ROGER** (*Remembering the rugby*) Tonight. Ahhh.        
**LISA** Is there a problem?        

# Page 53       

**ROGER** No. No problem. What time?        
**LISA** Seven.        
**ROGER** (*Biting his lip*) Seven. Umm (*Long pause, then said slowly*) Yeah.        
**LISA** Well I need to come in here to finish up my share of the cheese rolls. I'll be done by eight. You can meet me here then.        
**ROGER** (*Reluctantly*) Eight.        
**LISA** (*Forcefully*) You won't be late will you?        
**ROGER** (*Reluctantly*) No.        

*She turns away and Bruce does a sign for TV and nods his head towards kitchen where there is a TV.*        

**ROGER** (*Roger nods to Bruce*) No, that's fine I won't be late.        
**LISA** Good. I'll see you then.        

*Lisa leaves.*        

**ROGER** (*Mouths*) Shit!        

*Lights down to indicate end of scene and passage of time.*        

## SCENE 12        

*In the kitchen. Lisa is there. Roger enters.*        

**LISA** You said you wouldn't be late Roger.        
**ROGER** Sorry I needed to watch the first half (*Then realising what he has said tries to get out of it*) ...half... half dozen builders come to...come to...look at...look at....the kitchen.        
**LISA** Six builders?        
**ROGER** It's a big job.        
**LISA** At seven o'clock at night?        
**ROGER** They're flat out.        

*Lisa turns away from him, and he takes the chance to quickly tum the TV on, with mute on. She doesn't see the TV screen.*        

# Page 54       

**LISA** I think we should sit down. I'll sit... (*She goes to sit facing the TV screen*)        
**ROGER** NO! (*He grabs her and pulls her away from the seat and guides her so that he can see the TV but she can't)* Sorry. You sit here. It'll give you a view of....ah... (*Struggling to think*)... the carpark.        
**LISA** (*Slightly confused*) Okay. (*She looks in her handbag to find her phone and that gives Roger the chance to look at the TV for a few seconds*) Do you want to sit down?        
**ROGER** Sure. (*He reluctantly sits*)        
**LISA** Roger... (*She looks down so he moves his head very slightly to the right so he can see the TV*)        
**ROGER** (*Not paying attention, as he tries to watch the rugby*) Ah huh.        
**LISA** (*Sighs*) I've been feeling lately that.... this isn't easy.        
**ROGER** (*Watching kicker about to kick into the comer*) No it's not too bad.        
**LISA** What?        
**ROGER** (*His attention is back on her*) Nothing.        
**LISA** Things are different now aren't they?        
**ROGER** (*Not knowing what she is talking about*) Mmm.        
**LISA** I don't think things will be like they were.        
**ROGER** (*Still no idea what she's on about*) Things change.        
**LISA** We don't do much together anymore.        
**ROGER** No. We should.        

*Roger takes a sneaky look at the screen, which Lisa doesn't notice.*        

**LISA** We hardly ever go...        
**ROGER** (*Reflecting what he has just seen*) Out!        
**LISA** I know. I saw Jarred and Debbie going to the beach on Saturday and then they were going to a barbecue at Melanie's. I think it would have been a fun night. But we didn't do anything.        
**ROGER** (*Not really listening, and trying to see the TV without Lisa noticing*) No.        

# Page 55       

**LISA** Anyway I've been talking to a few people... well Mum... (*Roger tums off again and starts looking at the TV and Lisa looks down as she speaks*) and she thinks...well she says.....she's been in this situation herself...        
**ROGER** (*To himself. Referring to the game*) It's really tight.        
**LISA** What is?        
**ROGER** (*Nearly caught out*) Oh this shirt.       
**LISA** She says there are always options.        
**ROGER** (*Still not knowing what she is talking about*) Options. Yeah left and right. (*Then paying attention to her*) What did she mean by that?        
**LISA** You know, options.....different things we can do.        
**ROGER** Right. Right.        
**LISA** (*Looking down*) Maybe see someone about it?        
**ROGER** (*Again taking the chance to watch the game, so not really listening to her*) Mmm see someone. (*Then paying attention again*) About what?        
**LISA** Well everything.        
**ROGER** (*Still in the dark*) Ah huh.        
**LISA** Things aren't going well. Don't you think?        
**ROGER** (*Surprised*) You can see that?        
**LISA** It's obvious to everyone.        
**ROGER** (*Realising she's not talking about the game*) Oh. You mean...        
**LISA** (*She drops something and as she bends to pick it up he looks at the TV again*) I think time's running out.        
**ROGER** (*Talking about the rugby*) It is, but there's still time.        
**LISA** I'm not so sure. Things have changed so much. We used to be so happy together, we never used to get...        
**ROGER** Offside! (*He's still slyly looking at the TV*)        
**LISA** That's right.        
**ROGER** It was accidental.        
**LISA** I don't care who's to blame. (*She looks away*)        

# Page 56       

**ROGER** Go! Go! (*She looks back at him, confused*) Go on.        
**LISA** We always used to share similar views on things, now it seems like you disagree with me about everything.        
**ROGER** That's not true.        
**LISA** It is. (*She looks away again and he looks at the TV*) I think there needs to be some sort of....        
**ROGER** (*Excited*) Penalty!        
**LISA** No! I don't want you to think of it as a penalty.        
**ROGER** (*As if he misheard her*) Sorry?        
**LISA** I don't want it to be a penalty.        
**ROGER** Well it is.        
**LISA** There needs to be some sort of acknowledgement that we're both at fault sometimes. We need to meet...        
**ROGER** (*Referring to the place for the penalty*) Halfway. Just inside.        
**LISA** If that's possible.        
**ROGER** It is.        
**LISA** Well should we try that?        
**ROGER** What?        
**LISA** To meet half way.        
**ROGER** Oh yeah.        
**LISA** Oh I don't know. I just don't know if we can. Or if we should. There's so much I still want to do with my life. I want to travel and maybe take up riding again. (*Puts hand to her forehead so she can't see him. He glances at TV*) I mean you don't even take any notice of what I'm interested in - what my hobbies are. I guess what I'm trying to say Roger is... I think...I think it's over.        
**ROGER** (*Watching the rugby surreptitiously*) No it's not.        
**LISA** Pardon?        
**ROGER** It's not over.        
**LISA** I think I'll make that decision.        

# Page 57       

**ROGER** (*Still with one eye on the game*) What a wasted opportunity.        
**LISA** I know it is and that's what makes this so difficult.        
**ROGER** (*Referring to the rugby*) This could be the end.        
**LISA** And I don't want it to be, I really don't.        
**ROGER** (*Referring to the rugby*) Me either. Come on we have to keep going.        
**LISA** Yes.        
**ROGER** (*Referring to the rugby*) We've gotta take any chance.        
**LISA** I know but I just have these nagging doubts.        
**ROGER** (*Referring to the rugby*) We have to be focused!        
**LISA** Oh Roger it's great you're so committed.        
**ROGER** (*Referring to the rugby*) We've got to be committed.        
**LISA** I've never told you this before but what has made it extra hard for me is your friends. They haven't made me feel welcome in your circle. I think Debbie still has a thing for you, and Gary is...well he's such a....        
**ROGER** Dropkick!        
**LISA** Well I wouldn't have put it like that but he is a bit strange.        

*Roger stands up suddenly, clearly excited by something he has seen on the TV.*        

**LISA** What is it?        
**ROGER** I need to stretch. (*He is watching the TV behind his arm as he does so.*)       
**LISA** (*Getting tongue tied*) It's just.I think... I think..l'm...l'm...        
**ROGER** (*Referring to the rugby*) Come on! Come on!        
**LISA** (*Snapping*) I'm getting there Roger.       

*Roger sits but is still watching the game.*        

**LISA** And the other thing about Gary is, he's....        
**ROGER** (*Looking at the TV*) Not straight.        
**LISA** Well that's obvious but it doesn't bother me. I don't know if you've ever seen his...         

# Page 58       

**ROGER** Tackle!        
**LISA** Don't be disgusting. I was going to say his tattoo. He showed i to me-it's a swastika. I don't know what you see in him. I don't like him.        
**ROGER** (*Still looking at the TV*) He's going blind.        
**LISA** Oh my God! Still that's no excuse. He also keeps coming onto me.        
**ROGER** (*Still looking at the rugby*) Why would he do that?        
**LISA** I don't know, maybe he thinks I'm attractive.        
**ROGER** Big mistake. (*Pause*) He's been caught.        
**LISA** What?        
**ROGER** What?        
**LISA** He's been caught doing what?        
**ROGER** Who?        
**LISA** Gary.        
**ROGER** Ah... (*Trying desperately to think of something*) masturbating.        
**LISA** Urgh.        
**ROGER** Let's not talk about it.        
**LISA** Well it bothers me. Him coming onto me.        
**ROGER** (*Shaking his head in admiration*) He's good under the high ball.        
**LISA** What are you talking about?        
**ROGER** (*Trying to get out of it*) I'm talking about who you're talking about.        
**LISA** Gary?        
**ROGER** Yeah        
**LISA** (*Confused*) He's good under the high ball?        
**ROGER** He was - back when we played together.        
**LISA** So what. Don't change the subject Roger. It's not helpful.        
**ROGER** Sorry. (*Realising he has nearly been caught out he starts listening to her - for a bit anyway*)        
**LISA** I've been thinking about this for a long time.        

# Page 59       

**ROGER** Ah huh.        
**LISA** It's not something l've just come up with.        
**ROGER** No.        
**LISA** But it's still not clear to me.        
**ROGER** (*Clearly not knowing what she's talking about*) Me either.        
**LISA** I just have to go ahead and say what I have to say.        
**ROGER** (*Seeing the rugby again*) Oh this is getting unbearable.        
**LISA** I'm sorry I can't help that. It's very stressful for me too. One minute I'm happy enough, the next I'm thinking I should...        
**ROGER** Just throw it in!!        

*She looks at him. He thinks she has finally caught him out. There are a few seconds of awkward silence.*       

**LISA** Yes Roger. That's exactly what I've decided.        
**ROGER** About what?        
**LISA** You and me.        
**ROGER** What about us?        
**LISA** Our relationship.        
**ROGER** (*Seeing the final whistle being blown. He puts his head back*) That's the end. There's no tomorrow.        
**LISA** I'm glad you finally agree.        
**ROGER** (*Confused*) Mmm?        
**LISA** Goodbye Roger.        

*He looks confused. She gets up and walks off. He calls out to her.*        

**ROGER** Lisa! (*Pause*) What about the builders?        

*Lights down to indicate end of scene and passage of time.*        

## SCENE 13        

# Page 60       

*In the changing room. The team are in there with Raewyn doing ballroom dancing and Pilates. Stan is not there. Raewyn is dancing with Bruce. Chastity is dancing with Martin. The extras are doing Pilates in bright lycra.*        

**RAEWYN** (*To Bruce*) Put your left foot back; now together. That's it. (Looking over at Chastity and Martin) Hold her properly around the waist Martin.        
**BRUCE** (*To Raewyn*) You scrub up pretty well Raewyn.        
**RAEWYN** I'm not sure about that - I used to have an hour glass figure, now it's more like a gherkin jar.        
**BRUCE** (*Spinning her around*) Rubbish.        
**MARTIN** (*To Chastity*) Do you...do you do much dancing at home?        
**CHASTITY** No. I keep tripping over the rug in my lounge.        
**MARTIN** Oh.        
**CHASTITY** It's a shag rug.        

*Martin looks wide eyed, as he misinterprets what a shag rug is.*        

**CHASTITY** You should come over some time - you might get lucky...and not trip over.        

*Martin is again wide eyed, not knowing what to make of what she has said. He nods vigorously.*        

**MARTIN** What are you doing this weekend?        
**CHASTITY** Heaps of people have told me to go see Hamilton. So l've got tickets.        
**MARTIN** Cool.        

*Roger arrives, with some flowers for Raewyn.*        

**RAEWYN** Hello Roger.        
**ROGER** These are for you.        
**RAEWYN** Thank you. They're gorgeous.        
**ROGER** Gidday Bruce.        
**BRUCE** How did the Highlanders go in the semi?        
**ROGER** (*Abrupt*) Lost.        
**BRUCE** Oh.        

# Page 61       

*Lisa enters and immediately sees Roger.*       

**LISA** (*To Roger*) I'm here for the team.        
**ROGER** Yep.        
**LISA** How have you been?        
**ROGER** Good. You?        
**LISA** Yep. It's been pretty quiet. (*To the others*) Right you guys let's do some bridges. Have you done a warm up?        
**EXTRA 2** Yep.        
**LISA** Okay so lie flat on your back and raise your hips. (*Pause*) Hold it there. (*Pause*) And again.        

*Roger and the extras do the stretch. Roger speaks to Lisa as he is doing it.*        

**ROGER** I'm going to go on that robotics course. I'm going to get a qualification and make a go of it.        
**LISA** You are?        
**ROGER** Yep.        
**LISA** That's great.        
**ROGER** And when I get back - the first thing I'm doing is getting the kitchen done.... (*She looks at him, thinking 'well you've already started'*)... mean finished.        
**LISA** Now some rollups. Arms up. Stretch it out. (*The whole team including Bruce are stretching their arms*)        
**BRUCE** Like this?        
**LISA** Yep. (*Having second thoughts about the break up*) I was thinking Roger maybe we should have put a time on our breakup? - you know like a trial separation?        
**ROGER** Ok like maybe the four months I'm away in Oz?        
**LISA** Yeah. That might work.        
**ROGER** (*Hesitant*) And during that time will we be able to... see other people?        
**LISA** I think maybe two weeks would be better? What do you think?        
**ROGER** So just less people?        

# Page 62       

**LISA** Or one week even?        
**ROGER** Okay so one week.        
**LISA** Well I mean what's the point?        
**ROGER** Yeah what is the point. So we just forget about it?        
**LISA** Do you think so?        
**ROGER** I think so.        
**LISA** And when you're in Oz we'll be able to FaceTime each other all the time and..        
**TOGETHER** Text!        
**ROGER** Yeah.        
**LISA** When you get back maybe I'll watch some rugby games with you.        
**ROGER** Cool. And I'll take more interest in your hobby; knitting.        
**LISA** Embroidery.        
**ROGER** Yeah. Umm Lisa... (*Feeling guilty*) I've been keeping something from you - well, two things. It's just a little thing; two things.        
**LISA** What is it?        
**ROGER** I feel bad about not telling you earlier.        
**LISA** Just tell me Roger.        
**ROGER** (*He is really struggling with whether or not he should tell her about the kids, so he hesitates*) You know how....you know how....(*Pause*) you know how you make that chicken pie?        
**LISA** Yeah.        
**ROGER** I don't like the mushrooms in it. I don't like mushrooms in anything.        
**LISA** (*Being understanding and overly caring*) Why didn't you tell me?        
**ROGER** I didn't want to hurt your feelings. I know how much effort you put in to making it.        
**LISA** Oh Roger you're such a good man.        

*Roger shrugs, as if to say 'yes I am'.*        

**LISA** (Pause) What's the second thing?        

# Page 63       

**ROGER** I hate your mother.        
**LISA** (*Silence as she digests that comment*) She can be a bit difficult.        
**ROGER** Yeah.        

*Stan enters. He is taken by surprise by what he sees. ie the people dancing.*        

**STAN** (*Angry*) What's going on?        

*Everyone feels a bit guilty for going behind Stan's back.*        

**RAEWYN** Hi Stan I was just....I thought it would be good....        
**STAN** (*Interrupting*) How long's this been happening?        
**BRUCE** A couple of weeks. Raewyn and Lisa were just...        
**STAN** (*Interrupting*) In here? You've been doing it in here?        
**BRUCE** Yeah.        
**STAN** When I'm not around.        
**BRUCE** Well...        
**STAN** Get out. Out! Clear off - the lot of you! (*Brief pause*) Chastity -you know my training plan. We don't need this.        
**CHASTITY** Sorry Pops, I thought you knew.        
**STAN** No. I didn't. Please leave.        

*Everyone leaves except Raewyn.*        

**RAEWYN** What's wrong Stan?        
**STAN** They shouldn't need to be doing this. My trainings are fine - weights and K's. That's all they need. I don't want them doing it. And I'm the coach.        
**RAEWYN** It's just a bit of...        
**STAN** (*Interrupting*) No. It's a waste of time. They don't need it.        
**RAEWYN** (*Silence for a few seconds as Raewyn is shocked at this outburst*) Surely you're not upset about them doing some ballroom dancing and Pilates? It's good fitness work. They'll play better. They have been.        
**STAN** No. I don't want them doing it.        
**RAEWYN** I don't see why not?        

# Page 64       

**STAN** Well you're not the coach.        
**RAEWYN** Maybe not but it helped them in that last game.        
**STAN** No. No dancing.        
**RAEWYN** Come on Stan. Ballroom dancing? What's the problem? Too girly for you?       

*Stan shakes his head.*        

**RAEWYN** What is it then?        
**STAN** Don't worry about it.        
**RAEWYN** Tell me what it is.        
**STAN** It doesn't matter?        
**RAEWYN** Tell me Stan.        
**STAN** It's nothing.        
**RAEWYN** (*Getting angry*) No you don't kick out your whole team - guys who would do anything for you - and then say it's nothing! You better tell me Stanley.        
**STAN** (*Long silence, as he is very reluctant to say anything*) We used to have dances over at the hall on Saturday nights. Everyone went in those days. Margaret was very shy. When I asked her to dance she...she wouldn't. She didn't want everyone to see her. (*Pause*) So I suggested we come over here (*Pause*) We used to dance in here.        
**RAEWYN** (*Feeling bad for raising her voice*) I see.        
**STAN** She was a bloody good dancer. (*Pause*) I was tripping over my feet, and she would just glide around. Made her own dresses too.        
**RAEWYN** (*Silent for a few seconds*) Don't you think she would have wanted other people to dance here, when she couldn't?        
**STAN** Yeah, probably.        

*Another silence.*        

**RAEWYN** Would you dance with me Stan?        

*He says nothing. But after a few seconds he gets up slowly and takes her hand, and they dance for thirty seconds or so.*        

# Page 65       

**STAN** You know my grandfather proposed to my grandmother right here in the number one changing room, just after the seniors won the Grinder Cup for the first time. That was 1922. He said the boys had just left so it probably wasn't as tidy as this. (*It isn't in fact very tidy at all, with stuff everywhere*) But she's as good a spot as any... for that sort of thing.       
**RAEWYN** (*A touch of sarcasm*) Yes very romantic.       
**STAN** He gave her a two carat diamond ring. Saved for months for it he told me. I thought it was pretty special I was able to give that very same ring to Margaret when we got engaged.       
**RAEWYN** How lovely Stan.       
**STAN** Yeah. I had a hell of a job getting it off my grandmother's finger though.       

*Raewyn looks shocked. Stan waits a couple of seconds them smiles at her. Clearly he was making it up. She punches him lightly on the arm.*       

**RAEWYN** That's more like it.       

*They continue dancing.*       
*Lights down to indicate end of scene and passage of time.*       

## SCENE 14       

*In the changing room. Final practice before the final. Present to begin with are the Extras. Bruce and Roger are not there, nor Stan. Martin enters.*       

**MARTIN** Hello.       
**EXTRA 2** Gidday. (*Extra 1 just raises his eyebrows*)       
**MARTIN** Last practice.       
**EXTRA 2** Yep.       
**MARTIN** Where's Roger?       
**EXTRA 2** Dunno       

*Stan enters.*       

**STAN** (*Sounding a bit down*) Fellas.       
**ALL** Gidday/Hi Stan.       
**STAN** Ready for a big one?       

# Page 66       

**ALL** Yep/Yeah.        
**STAN** Season's gone fast.        
**MARTIN** What have you got there Stan?        
**STAN** It's from Andrea Vance. (*Hands letter to Martin*) Basically repeats everything we already know. She's gonna make an offer for the land when the final's over.        
**EXTRA 2** Bit hasty - we could still be here next season.        
**STAN** That's right.        
**EXTRA 2** If we win.        
**MARTIN** You haven't heard then? (*Stan looks at him*) Sludge has sprained his ankle. He tripped over a paint can. He can't walk.        
**STAN** I don't need him to walk...        
**MARTIN** (*Interrupting*) No he's stuffed Stan. He can't play.        
**STAN** Arse cheeks!        

*Bruce enters.*        

**STAN** Sludge's out with a sprained ankle.        
**MARTIN** And they're going ahead with the rest home.        

*Martin hands Bruce the letter.*        

**BRUCE** I don't think so. (*They all look at him*) They're not gonna build it here. My report says the ground's unsuitable for building; for new builds.        
**ALL** That's great/Terrific/Good news etc        

*Stan takes Bruce aside.*        

**STAN** (*To Bruce*) Is the ground really unsuitable for building?        
**BRUCE** It is for two storey buildings. You'd need very expensive fifteen metre deep piles. Not financially viable.        
**STAN** But rest homes are only ever one storey aren't they - for obvious reasons. Did it say that in your report?        
**BRUCE** That they could still build a one storey rest-home? What do you think?        
**STAN** Integrity Bruce.        

# Page 67       

**BRUCE** I think integrity fluctuates during the day.        
**STAN** Do you?        
**BRUCE** Yeah. I find I have a lot of integrity in the afternoons.        
**STAN** Integrity in the afternoons eh. When did you write the report?        
**BRUCE** As you know Stan, I only work in the mornings. (*Smiles*)        
**STAN** (*Slowly smiles*) Good on ya fella.        
**MARTIN** Did you get your report peer reviewed given the obvious conflict of interest?        
**BRUCE** Of course I did. (*Pause*) I got Chastity to peer review it. (*Pause*) She thought it looked very nice. (*Smiles*)        

*Martin shakes his head.*        

**MARTIN** We still need to win the final though, or some other company'll buy the land - and build something without piles, like a carpark.        
**BRUCE** Well that's true.        

*Bruce gives Stan a knowing look as he knows they will be another man down, and Stan looks a bit worried.*        

**MARTIN** Don't you think they would have got their own report done?        
**BRUCE** I thought of that.        
**MARTIN** And?        
**BRUCE** I bloody hope not.        

*Bruce takes Stan aside.*        

**BRUCE** (*To Stan*) I bumped into Kevin McClay in the pub. He had a Rolex he was about to sell in his shop. He said he thought it might have been yours.        
**STAN** How's that?        
**BRUCE** Because it's got your name on the back of it. (*Pause*) And the other give away was that you came into his shop and sold it to him. (*Pause*) The day before we had an anonymous donation of thirty K to pay for Roger's trip.        
**STAN** Is that right. Coincidence.        

# Page 68       

**BRUCE** You do know the course starts in Melbourne on Saturday. The same day as the final?        
**STAN** Yeah I know.        
**BRUCE** He won't be able to play.        
**STAN** It's his future Bruce.        
**BRUCE** (*Accepting*) I know.        
**STAN** He's already gone. He's sorry he missed ya; wished us all well Were gonna have to play a man down.        
**BRUCE** It's Roger, Stan- he's worth more than one man. And we haven't got Sludge either.        
**STAN** (*Remembering*) Oh yeah. (*Scratches his head*) Shit.        

*Raewyn enters.*        

**RAEWYN** (*To Stan*) Have the twins been in touch?        
**STAN** No.        
**RAEWYN** They've got the norovirus. They won't be playing on Saturday.        
**STAN** What?! A little virus won't stop them.        
**RAEWYN** No- they're going from both ends. Everyone at Mitre 10's got it.        
**STAN** That's our whole front row gone. And a back. We're stuffed.        

*Lights down to indicate end of scene and passage of time.*        

## SCENE 15        

*The day of the final. In the changing rooms before the game. The team enters carrying boots etc. Stan greets them.*        

**STAN** (*A bit down*) Fellas. Good to see you.        
**MARTIN** What are we going to do Stan?        
**STAN** Can I just say how pleased I am you all turned up even though we cant play with only eleven.        
Everyone looks quiet and reflective.        
**MARTIN** Can't we ask them to drop some?        

# Page 69       

**STAN** No. We could if we were only one down but we don't even have a front row. We're going to have to default.        
**ALL** Oh/Really?        
**STAN** We came so close to having that magnificent trophy in our clubrooms.        
**BRUCE** We came a lot closer than we thought we'd get.        
**STAN** Yep. It's not meant to be fellas, but I'm bloody grateful to you for trying to keep the club alive.        

*Silence for a few seconds as everyone reflects       
Andrea enters wearing a trench-coat.*       

**STAN** (*Annoyed*) What are you doing here?        
**ANDREA** (*Appearing quite happy*) I hear you're missing a few players.        
**STAN** Don't sound so happy about it.        
**ANDREA** I'm not.        
**STAN** So why are you here?        
**ANDREA** I thought you might like to know we're not going to be building our Continuing Care Resort here.        
**EXTRA 2** Great. Why's that?        
**ANDREA** Turns out the land isn't suitable for building with the new regulations. You'd have to put special foundations down.        
Stan looks over at Bruce who smiles.        
**STAN** Is that right. Well thank you for that - you can go now.        
**ANDREA** I'm also here to offer my services.        
**STAN** We don't need a property developer thank you.        
**ANDREA** (*Removing her coat*) I played prop for my high school for three years. I'll give you a hand.        
**STAN** (*Gobsmacked*) What?!        
**ANDREA** I was reading your book on the history of the Club. I knew some of my relations had come from this area but I didn't know my great great grandfather was a founding member. Albert Vance. I don't want to see the club go under either.        
**STAN** Bloody good of you but...but...you're a girl.        

# Page 70       

**ANDREA** Yes.        
**STAN** Martin! Can girls play?        
**MARTIN** Where's the rule book?        
**BRUCE** (*Throws it to him*) Here!        

*Martin starts flicking through it.*        

**STAN** We'd still be short anyway.        

*Raewyn enters wearing rugby gear.*        

**RAEWYN** I'll pack down for you.        
**STAN** Raewyn!        
**RAEWYN** This gherkin jar can do a bit of damage.        
**MARTIN** (*Looking up from the rule book*) It doesn't differentiate. It seems 'players' can be either male or female. I think it's fine.        
**STAN** Great. So we've got two of the four.        

*Chastity enters and everyone turns their heads towards her.*        

**CHASTITY** Hiya!        
**STAN** You used to play rugby when you were a nipper Chastity?        
**CHASTITY** Yeah.        
**STAN** Fancy throwing on the boots for one more game?        
**CHASTITY** (*Reluctant*) Will I get...will I get.muddy?        
**STAN** Probably. Is that a problem?        
**CHASTITY** No. I don't mind getting a bit dirty. (*Stan looks at the Extra who has previously made rude comments, and puts his finger up to make sure he doesn't say anything*)        
**RAEWYN** (*Pointedly*) You can be hooker.        

*Chastity is thrown a jersey and quickly steps offstage to put it on. And retums.*        

**STAN** Right, listen up everyone. I don't want you to think this is the most important thing you've ever done in your lives - I don't want you to be under that sort of pressure.        
**MARTIN** So what's the plan Stan?        

# Page 71       

**STAN** Don't get smart Martin. Now because it's the final l've been giving it a lot of thought. It's very important we get the tactics right. So what we're gonna do..... is go... (*He holds his hand out to the audience, deliberately breaking the fourth wall - and they will spontaneously say 'Up the guts'. And even if they don't, the team members will all say it TEAM Up the guts.*)       
**STAN** Keep your voices down, they'll hear!        
**BRUCE** Do you think we should do something different?        
**STAN** No - that's what they'll be expecting. Then we're gonna pile in over the top making sure we keep our feet, clear the pill and...TEAM Spin it wide.        
**STAN** Shuuussshh. And if we win you can have free beer at the Whitehouse for a week...        

*Roar of approval.*        

**MARTIN** But I don't dri... (*About to say 'drink'*)        
**STAN** Ginger beer - you can have ginger beer Martin. (*Pause*) Now it's not gonna be easy. Woodbridge have got form - top qualifier and they smashed Blues in the semi. We're still one down - and it's our best player. I'm thinking maybe we need a few words of inspiration from our mental skills coach.        
**BRUCE** Do you think so?        
**STAN** Yes. Chastity.        
**CHASTITY** (*Glances off stage*) I think there's only one thing that could possibly save us...        
**STAN** *(Interrupting. Annoyed she seems to be being negative again*) Chastity!        

*Chastity points offstage. Roger enters from that direction.*        

**STAN** Roger!        
**ROGER** Gidday.        
**STAN** What are you doing here fella? You're supposed to be in Melbourne.        
**ROGER** I was gonna tell them my Grandfather died, but then I thought 'What would Stan do?', so I told them the truth. They're letting me start the course on Monday.        

# Page 72       

*Hearing that makos Stan feel a bit guilty about going along with Bruce's misleading Geotech report. So he looks a bit guilty, then snaps out of it.*        

**STAN** Well it's bloody good to see you. Get your gear on.        
**RAEWYN** Who's reffing?        
**ROGER** I bumped into him out there. It's Grievous.        
**BRUCE** Paul Grieve?        
**STAN** Yep. One eyed old coot.        
**RAEWYN** Steady on Stan, we don't get into that sort of thing.        
**STAN** No he is one eyed- forestry accident a few years back.        
**ROGER** He said he's forgotten his red and yellow cards.        
**STAN** Great! No cards today then.        
**ROGER** No he said he'll sort it out.        

*Stan takes Andrea aside.*        

**STAN** (*Feeling guilty*) Andrea. About that Geotech report.        
**ANDREA** What about it?        
**STAN** The thing is... well...when it said our fields are unsuitable for building - that's only for two storey buildings. You could still build a one storey rest-home with no problems. So I'd understand if you didn't want to play now.        
**ANDREA** I know.        
**STAN** (Surprised) You do?        
**ANDREA** We got our own report done. It said we could build on one level, but we were always going to have to build a two storey admin block...        
**STAN** (Finishing her sentence. Nodding) And that would've been too expensive.        
**ANDREA** It would have been expensive, but we could have managed it.        
**STAN** So why not?        
**ANDREA** (Shrugs) The Board went with Bruce's report.        
**STAN** Why's that?        

# Page 73       

**ANDREA** Because I didn't show them the other one. (Pause for a couple of seconds. Loudly, shaking clenched fist) Green and Gold all the way!!! Green and gold we'll have our day!!!        
**STAN** (Smiling) Thank you. I'll just go and wish their coach all the best.        

*Stan leaves.*        

**RAEWYN** We should get Stan something.        
**BRUCE** Why?        
**RAEWYN** To thank him for being our coach.        
**BRUCE** We don't need to. He won't expect to get a gift.        
**LISA** That's not the point Bruce - it's a nice thing to do. We can all put in for        
**BRUCE** He won't want anything.        
**LISA** (*Forceful*) Bruce.        
**BRUCE** (*Not convinced but resigned*) Alright. I'll take care of it.        
**MARTIN** (*To Chasity*) I meant to ask - how was Hamilton?        
**CHASTITY** I don't know what the big deal was - I prefer Palmerston North.        

*Stan returns.*        

**STAN** Turns out they're also short.        
**MARTIN** So do they have to default?        
**STAN** No they've got some ring-ins. They're fielding some ineligible players I have to say.        
**ROGER** Are you going to complain? Won't they have to default?        
**STAN** No. I won't say anything. It's not the Valley way. We'll let them play. (*Wandering around the players as they get ready*) Now don't forget how important the pill is. Respect the pill. Right line up everyone. (*Looking at the players in their uniforms ready to go out to play*) Now that looks smart. I have to say you looked like a bunch of bloody liquorice all-sorts when you were doing that pointless Pilates carry on. Off you go. (*As they are leaving*) Good luck fellas.... and others. Remember - use the pill.        
**CHASTITY** (*To Lisa as they are about to run out*) It's good he supports birth control isn't it.        

# Page 74       

*Lights down while there are sound effects of a game of rugby starting with the whistle for kick off. There is the noise of the crowd as well and a voice-over giving the score. This will only go for a few seconds.*       

**VOICE** Seven nil to Woodbridge.       

*A few more seconds of noise.*       

**VOICE** Fourteen nil to Woodbridge.       

*Chastity comes running into changing room upset and sounding in pain.*       

**CHASTITY** I've broken something.       
**STAN** (*Concerned*) What?!       
**CHASTITY** My nail.       
**STAN** (*Compassionate*) Here - give me a look.       
**CHASTITY** I can't go back on - I might break more of them.       

*Lights down and a few more seconds of sound effects.*       

**VOICE** At halftime Woodbridge lead 20 points to 12.       

*Lights stay down.*       

**VOICE** Early in the second half in the top of the table clash between Woodbridge and Valley it's all squared up at 20 all.       

*Lights up.*       

**STAN** What's happening? What's the stoppage for? (*Intently watching what's happening*) Oh shit - that's all we need!       

*Roger trudges into the changing room, dejected.*       

**ROGER** I got a red card. Well it was a Whitcoulls Gift card.       
**STAN** (*Panicking*) We need you out there Roger! Hold on - what'd ya say you got? A Whitcoulls gift card?       
**ROGER** Yeah you know, those red ones.       
**STAN** Is that legal? I mean is that even legal?       
**ROGER** I don't know.       
**STAN** Where's Martin?       
**CHASTITY** He's on the wing.       

# Page 75       

**STAN** Quick Chastity - pull him off, I mean get him off. (*To Roger*) How did you get it?        
**ROGER** The ref got knocked over when he was showing it to me. He dropped it so I picked it up. (*Shows it to him*)        
**STAN** No I mean why did you get it? What happened?        
**ROGER** It was an accidental - deliberate head clash.        
**STAN** What's an accidental - deliberate head clash?        
**ROGER** They thought it was accidental but it was deliberate.        
**STAN** Oh Roger! You're our best player. Shit they've scored! Drop goal.        
**VOICE** Woodbridge 23, Valley 20        

*Martin comes in panting.*        

**MARTIN** What is it?        
**STAN** Roger's been given a Whitcoulls gift card - is that allowed?        

*Martin grabs the rule book.*        

**STAN** We need him out there, we're leaking points. Hurry!        
**MARTIN** It has to be a World Rugby approved Red or Yellow card. So a Whitcoulls gift card is no good.        
**STAN** Right I need to speak to the ref.        
**CHASTITY** No you can't!        

*Stan leaves anyway and passes Bruce.*        

**STAN** Where are you going?        
**BRUCE** I need a drink.        
**STAN** We need you on the field!        
**BRUCE** It's alright - they're taking a kick at goal.        

*Bruce goes to open a beer. Stan sees him.*        

**STAN** Water! Bruce.        

*Bruce groans.*        

**ROGER** Do you think I can keep the card?        

# Page 76       

**CHASTITY** How much is it for?        
**ROGER** Thirty bucks.        
**CHASTITY** Thirty bucks. That's hopeless. You can't buy any books with thirty bucks. They're at least thirty-five for a decent one.        
**ROGER** Really?        
**CHASTITY** Yeah. You can't buy a good book for thirty bucks.        
**ROGER** (*Surprised*) Do you buy books?        
**CHASTITY** (*Indignant*) Yes.        
**BRUCE** Do you want me to have it? (*Roger doesn't answer but Bruce carefuly takes it out of his hands*)        

*Stan re-enters.*        

**STAN** (*To Bruce*) Get back out there! They turned me round. Couldn't get near 'em.        
**CHASTITY** (*To Martin*) Give it to me. (*She grabs the rule book and runs off. Martin goes with her*)       

*Lights down again briefly. Chastity and Martin return.*        

**CHASTITY** They've accepted he can't be red carded.        
**STAN** Great.        
**MARTIN** But he has to do an HIA before he can go back on, he got hit in a big tackle just before he came off.        
**STAN** He'll be fine. Roger - on a scale of one to ten how hard were you hit?        
**ROGER** Twice.        

*Stan looks at Martin.*        

**MARTIN** He has to do an HIA.        
**STAN** What's that stand for again?        
**MARTIN** Head Injury Assessment.        
**STAN** That's right. You get back out there Martin. We've got a form... he has to answer some questions and get them all right. Chastity can you. iis over there. Quicklyl (*She hands it to him*) I've always wondered what sort of questions they ask them. Right. Roger pay attention. Roger!        

# Page 77       

(*Roger is dreamily looking away*) Look this way! Roger! (*Looking at the sheet*) What day is it?        
**ROGER** Umm. (*Long pause*)        
**STAN** Well what day do we normally play rugby?        
**ROGER** Ummm?        

*Roger looks unsure.*        

**STAN** It's going to be either Saturdee or Sundee isn't it.        
**ROGER** Sunday.        
**STAN** Or?        
**ROGER** Saturday.        
**STAN** Correct! (*He ticks something and reads the next question*) if I was your mother, could you marry me?        
**ROGER** What?        
**STAN** (*Slower*) If I was your mother could you marry me? (*Long pause to give Roger time to answer*) (*To himself*) No obviously.        
**ROGER** No.        
**STAN** That's right. (*Ticks the sheet*)        
**VOICE** Valley scores and converts, 27-23 to Valley.        
**STAN** Hurrahl! We're in the lead. Oh I'm not asking him this! Everyone knows it's Richie McCaw.        
**CHASTITY** You have to ask him.        
**STAN** Who is the greatest rugby player of all time?        
**ROGER** Richie McCaw.        
**STAN** (*To Chastity*) I told you he'd know. Next one - how do you spell Hormone?        
**ROGER** Hormone. W. H...        
**STAN** (*Interrupting*) We'll try another one. (*To Chastity*) What does that say?        
**CHASTITY** Yuckt. How do you spell Yuckt?        
**STAN** It's yacht! No no that's too hard. How do you spell Cage?        

# Page 78       

**CHASTITY** Ah is that how does he spell it or how do you spell it correctly?        
**STAN** Good question Chasity. (*Looking at the sheet*) It says 'How do you spell cage'. So it's how does he spell it. How do you spell cage Roger        
**ROGER** Cage. C..A...D...G...E        
**STAN** That's how you spell it. Correct.        
**VOICE** Try to Woodbridge. Conversion's good. Woodbridge leads 30-27. Two minutes to go.        
**STAN** Bloody hell. Right, the last one. It's multiple choice. What is the only planet in the solar system that has an atmosphere made up of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen?        
**ROGER** Aye?        
**STAN** A. That's right. Earth. For interest the other options were B - Mercury, C- Jupiter, and D - Uranus; 1 don't think that was needed. So you've got everything right! You can get back out there.        
**ROGER** But I might be concluded.        
**STAN** Concussed. You're fine. On you go. Hurry!        
**CHASTITY** That's a relief.        
**STAN** I know.        
**CHASTITY** I'm glad I didn't have to answer them.        

*Stan is on his feet desperately trying to see what's happening on the field.*        

**STAN** TRY! (*Brief pause*) What??? That was a try!! He got it down! He got it down! Grievous hasn't given it. It was bloody obvious!!        
**CHASTITY** (*Also trying to look*) Where was it?        
**STAN** Left hand touch, just inside. (*Then dawns on him*) NOOO!! He can't see out that side! We've been robbed.        
**CHASTITY** Drop out. Gone deep.        
**STAN** (*Struggling to see*) What's happening?        
**CHASTITY** Roger's got it. Sidestep. Beats another. He's passed to Raewyn. Ooo! (*Indicating a painful collision*) Martin fumbles, no he's got it, to Andrea to Bruce. Good pass.        
**STAN** What's going on?        

# Page 79       

**CHASTITY** Bruce has been tackled. He's just short....Oh no! (*Roar of the crowd is heard and final whistle blows*) (*Not sounding jubilant*) That's it. It's over.        
**STAN** What happened? I couldn't see.        
**CHASTITY** I don't know.        
**STAN** There's people everywhere.        

*Stan is hopping about trying to see out the window. A few seconds later Bruce staggers in, dazed, followed by Martin, then Raewyn and Roger.*        

**STAN** What happened Bruce?! Too many people in the way. I didn't see.        
**ROGER** We won the ball from the dropout crashed it up the centre.        
**STAN** Up the guts. Great!        
**BRUCE** I got the ball out wide, just near the touch line...        
**STAN** What were you doing on the wing?! (*Pause*) Oh never-mind.        
**MARTIN** He tiptoed down the line like a dancer.        
**STAN** Did he?        
**BRUCE** Yep. Kept my balance. Managed to stay in. Just.        
**RAEWYN** He got through a gap, and put on a burst of speed like someone trying to get the last potato top pie at the dairy.        
**BRUCE** I got tackled short of the line. Bodies on top of me, crushing me. Honesty Stan I could hardly breathe, sweat was in my eyes, everything was a blur...I had the ball up off the ground, I reached out...the line was just too far... just out of reach... Maybe 5 centimetres that's all. (*Pause*) (*Sounding disappointed*) We only needed that one try to win the game...        
**STAN** (*Gutted*) Ohhh.        
**BRUCE** I gave it everything Stan. I gave it one last final effort - you see l've got that little extra bit of flexibility now- and I got the ball right down on the line!!        
**STAN** You did?!        
**BRUCE** I did. We won Stan!        
**STAN** No shit?!        
**BRUCE** No shit.        

# Page 80       

**STAN** We won!! (*Pause*) Fucking brilliant!!!       

*General back slapping and hugging etc. The extras slip away to get changed for the final scene.*       

**LISA** They were a lot smaller than I thought they'd be.       
**STAN** Yeah well they got hit a bit by the Covid, that's why they had those ineligible ring-ins - half that team was the Woodbridge Under 11 Reds.       
**RAEWYN** Why didn't you tell us?!       
**STAN** I didn't want you to go easy on the little bastards!       
**LISA** The best bit was the oranges at half time.       
**ALL** Yeah/That was good.       
**LISA** Were they blood oranges?       
**MARTIN** No there was just blood on them.       
**LISA** Ughhh.       
**STAN** I'm so proud of you - you played like men. (*Then looking at the women and realising he needs to include them*) And men-like people. Right hit the showers, then we can celebrate. (*They start leaving*) Separate showers... Chastity!       

Everyone leaves except Stan. His phone rings.       

**STAN** Hello. (*Pause*) (*Surprised*) Simon. Where are you? (*Brief pause*) You didn't hang around? (*Pause*) You should have come in. (*Pause*) Well thank you very much son. I won't lie to you, it feels pretty bloody good to beat Woodbridge. It was touch and go for a while there. (*Pause*) How did they take it? (*Brief pause*) Crying? (*Pause*) I'm sorry to hear that. (*Pause*) That's right - the old move - didn't think we'd do it did you? Oh you did. (*Pause*) They were great weren't they. You'd think they'd been playing all season. (*Pause*) You had some big boys. (*Pause*) Next year? Haven't given it much thought yet. (*Pause*) Yeah we should pick up some sponsors now. Everyone likes a winning team. (*Pause*) Have you? Already? (*Pause*) You're not going to play overseas are you? (*Brief pause*) Good. You're not worthy of those bloody North Islanders. (*Surprised*) Really? You're sure? Well I reckon we could make room for you. That'd be bloody good. Hey why don't you come round for a cuppa tomorrow, we can talk about it? (*Long pause*) Great. I'll look forward to it.       

*He hangs up and smiles to himself.*

## SCENE 16        

*The next day. In the changing rooms. Everyone is present.*        

**MARTIN** (*Holding his stomach*) I think I drank too much ginger beer last night.        
**BRUCE** Can't hold your grog Martin?        
**STAN** (*To Roger*) When are you away?        
**ROGER** This afternoon.        
**STAN** All the best fella. I'm sure you'll do well.        
**ROGER** Cheers Stan. I don't know how to thank you for what you did.        
**STAN** (*Pause, as Stan didn't know that Roger has found out it was him, and is wondering where he should admit it*) Are you gonna play for us next season?        
**ROGER** Too right.        
**STAN** We'll call it even then.        

*They shake hands.*        

**STAN** (*Nods towards the women*) The girls played well didn't they? I mean the ladies.        
**ROGER** I'll say.        
**STAN** She's tough as nails that Raewyn. You should have seen the ruck marks on her back.        
**LISA** Those were from her bra straps.        
**STAN** Oh. (*Remembering something*) Oh does anyone know anything about some flowers going missing from Colin McElrea's garden? He said it's been happening a lot.        

*Roger looks down.*        

**ALL** No.        
**STAN** Didn't think so. I've also had a call from Crusty - he's on board for at least another year with sponsorship.        
**ALL** Great.        

# Page 82       

**BRUCE** (*To everyone*) Right - we wanted to meet up today to thank Stan for all his work as our coach. Stan you're a great coach.        
**STAN** Well I was once compared to Steve Hansen.        
**MARTIN** Really?        
**STAN** Yeah - they said I was nothing like him. (*Chuckles to himself and the others do too*)        
**BRUCE** We got you a small gift Stan.        
**STAN** Oh you shouldn't have.        
**BRUCE** No no, we wanted to.        

*The women roll their eyes. Bruce gives him a large wrapped parcel.*        

**STAN** Thanks very much.        

*He unwraps it, and he looks in.*        

**EXTRA 2** What is it?        
**STAN** It's a Whitcoulls gift card... (*Picks it up and tums it over*) Thirty dollars.        

*The women all glare at Bruce, who just shrugs.*        

**STAN** There's something else in here. (*He pulls out a small container and opens it. He is nearly speechless. It's the Rolex*) My watch. (*Quite emotional. Puts hand to his mouth*) How did you..?        
**BRUCE** Kevin McClay gave it to us in exchange for having his shop's name on our jerseys for three years.        
**STAN** That was good of him.        
**RAEWYN** Yeah, it was. There's just one thing - he insisted on a change of jersey for the next three seasons.        
**STAN** (*Wary*) To what?        
**RAEWYN** His shop's colours. (*She gingerly pulls a jersey out of a bag and holds it up - it's bright pink and white*)        

*Stan looks horrified.*        

**BRUCE** What'da ya say Stan?        
**STAN** (*Silent for a few seconds, then hesitantly*) Pink and white.. all the way, pink and white we'll have our day!        

# Page 83       

**ALL** Hurrahh!        

*The team mill about. Martin and Chastity move to one side.*       

**MARTIN** Chastity.        
**CHASTITY** Yeah.        
**MARTIN** Is it true you slept with half the team last year?        
**CHASTITY** Half? No.        
**MARTIN** A quarter?        
**CHASTITY** No.        
**MARTIN** An eighth?        
**CHASTITY** Is that like, the Number 8?        
**MARTIN** No.        
**CHASTITY** The first five eighth?        
**MARTIN** No.        
**CHASTITY** The second five eighth?        
**MARTIN** (*Now impatient*) Look just tell me Chastity - did you?!        
**CHASTITY** I can't believe you're asking. After all we've been through.        
**MARTIN** (*Confused*) We haven't been through anything.        
**CHASTITY** No I know but it sounds better to say that.        
**MARTIN** I'm sorry if you think I don't trust you, I just need to know. It's eating me up. It's something I constantly think about, that and how to properly sidestep.        
**CHASTITY** (*Being very genuine*) I didn't sleep with any of them.        
**MARTIN** You didn't?        
**CHASTITY** No.        
**MARTIN** But...        
**CHASTITY** I know what everyone says. It's all lies. I've been the victim of online trawling.        
**MARTIN** Trolling.        

# Page 84       

**CHASTITY** Yeah that I'm a Virgo Martin.        
**MARTIN** (*Hopeful*) Virgin?        
**CHASTITY** (*Pause*) No. Virgo. I'm very loyal. (*Pause*) And I'm not interested in anyone else. (*Brief pause*) At the moment.        
**MARTIN** I'm so pleased to hear that Chastity.        
**CHASTITY** So am I.        

*Focus switches to Lisa and Roger.*        

**LISA** You know Roger, honesty is a big part of our relationship.        
**ROGER** (*Surprised*) Is it?        
**LISA** Of course it is!        
**ROGER** Oh yeah, yeah. It is. It is a part.        
**LISA** A big part.        
**ROGER** A big part. That's what I was saying to you the other day.        
**LISA** Yeah. I'm so pleased you've been honest with me about everything now.        
**ROGER** Well that's how it should be isn't it?        
**LISA** Yeah. Do you know who those kids are who keep following us around?        
**ROGER** (*He nods and puts his arm around her shoulders*) Orphans. (*They begin to walk off together*)        
**STAN** Hey did anyone from the media speak to any of you guys?        
**ALL** No/Nup        
**STAN** (*Surprised*) Well, what a bloody waste of time all my training was. They could have least been here to take a picture of us with The Grinder Cup. (*He holds it up - it is tiny - like The Ashes um size. The team all gather together around it*)        
Martin wanders over to Bruce who is sitting looking at his phone. Concerned.        
**MARTIN** What are you looking at Bruce?        
**BRUCE** (*Sounding worried*) Met Service. (*Pause*) Oh shit!!        
**MARTIN** What is it?        

# Page 85       

**BRUCE** (*Almost in tears*) There's a big low coming.
